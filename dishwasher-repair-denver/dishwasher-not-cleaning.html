            <h1>Dishwasher Not Cleaning: Causes &amp; Diagnosis</h1>
            <p class="hero-text">Pulling dishes out still dirty defeats the purpose of owning a dishwasher. The cause could be anything from a clogged spray arm to water temperature issues to a worn wash impeller. The sections below walk through each common cause and what you can check before calling for service.</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section>
        <div class="container">
            <div class="content-body">
                <h2>Quick Answer</h2>
                <p>A dishwasher that leaves dishes dirty after a full cycle has a break in one of four systems: water delivery (not enough water reaching dishes), water temperature (not hot enough to activate detergent), mechanical action (spray arms not spinning or not generating adequate pressure), or detergent timing (dispenser not opening at the right point in the cycle). The most common single cause is a clogged or damaged spray arm — which is also the most accessible component to inspect yourself before calling for service.</p>

                <h2>Common Causes</h2>
                <p><strong>Clogged or Damaged Spray Arms:</strong> The spray arms rotate and project water at high pressure to clean dishes. Hard water deposits mineral buildup inside the small spray nozzle holes over time, reducing pressure and coverage. Food particles clog nozzles as well. If the arm's center bearing is worn, the arm won't rotate at all, leaving entire zones of dishes unwashed. A visibly cracked arm will leak water sideways instead of projecting it toward dishes.</p>

                <p><strong>Worn Wash Impeller:</strong> Inside the wash pump, an impeller with curved fins forces water up through the spray arms under pressure. As impeller fins wear down or crack from years of use and mineral abrasion, the pump loses the ability to generate adequate pressure. Water may circulate, but too weakly to dislodge food residue and grease.</p>

                <p><strong>Low Water Level or Defective Inlet Valve:</strong> The water inlet valve controls how much water enters the tub at the start of each cycle. A valve that fails to open fully leaves the tub partially filled. With insufficient water volume, spray arms cannot deliver meaningful pressure to the dish load. A partially blocked inlet filter strainer produces the same symptom.</p>

                <p><strong>Water Temperature Too Low:</strong> Modern dishwasher detergent is formulated to activate at around 120°F. If the home's water heater is set too low, or if the dishwasher's internal heating element has failed, detergent does not dissolve properly and grease is not emulsified — leaving a film on dishes even after a complete cycle.</p>

                <p><strong>Broken Detergent Dispenser:</strong> The dispenser door is spring-loaded to open at a specific point in the wash cycle. If the spring has broken, the latch has seized, or the solenoid that controls it has failed, the dispenser stays closed and detergent is never released into the wash water. The machine runs a full cycle in effectively plain water.</p>

                <h2>Checks You Can Do Yourself</h2>
                <p><strong>Inspect the spray arms:</strong> Remove the bottom rack and rotate each spray arm by hand — it should turn smoothly and freely. Look closely at the nozzle holes; mineral deposits appear as white or gray calcification around or inside each hole. A wire, pipe cleaner, or toothpick can clear individual clogged nozzles. Rinse the arm under running water after clearing.</p>

                <p><strong>Soak spray arms in vinegar:</strong> Remove the spray arms entirely (most unscrew or unclip from the center post) and soak them in white vinegar for 30 minutes. The acid dissolves mineral deposits inside the nozzles. Rinse thoroughly and re-install. This is one of the most effective maintenance steps in hard-water areas.</p>

                <p><strong>Check water level mid-cycle:</strong> Start a wash cycle and carefully open the door a few inches once filling begins. The water level should reach partway up the tub — roughly covering the bottom of the lower rack. Significantly less water indicates an inlet valve or control issue.</p>

                <p><strong>Test the detergent dispenser:</strong> Push the dispenser door shut — it should latch firmly. Then push the release tab — it should spring open immediately with a sharp snap. Stiff action or a door that won't stay latched indicates a worn spring or latch that will not open reliably during the cycle.</p>

                <p><strong>Check incoming water temperature:</strong> Run the kitchen faucet on hot for 60 seconds before starting the dishwasher. This ensures the first water entering the tub is already at operating temperature rather than starting cold from a long run of pipe.</p>

                <p><strong>Clean the filter trap:</strong> Most dishwashers have a removable filter at the bottom of the tub that catches food particles. Remove and rinse it monthly. A heavily clogged filter forces dirty water back through the spray system and degrades cleaning performance across the whole cycle.</p>

                <h2>What NOT to Do</h2>
                <p>Do not disassemble the wash pump or attempt to replace the impeller yourself. The pump housing is sealed under the tub and requires partial machine disassembly to access. Improper reassembly can create water leaks or allow water into the motor housing.</p>

                <p>Do not run repeated cycles attempting to force improvement without addressing the underlying cause. If the spray arms are clogged or the impeller is worn, additional cycles only add heat cycles to an already-failing system without improving cleaning results.</p>

                <p>Do not assume the problem is detergent brand or quantity before checking the mechanical components. A detergent switch rarely resolves a cleaning failure caused by a blocked spray arm or a failed inlet valve.</p>

                <h2>When to Call a Professional</h2>
                <p>If cleaning does not improve after clearing spray arm nozzles, verifying water temperature, and confirming the detergent dispenser opens — the fault is inside a component that requires electrical testing or partial disassembly to assess. A worn impeller, a failing inlet valve, or a defective heating element cannot be confirmed through visual inspection alone; each requires continuity or flow-rate testing with diagnostic tools.</p>

                <p>If the spray arm itself is cracked, visibly damaged, or its center bearing is worn through, it needs replacement. If water level is persistently low despite a clean inlet filter strainer, the inlet valve solenoid has likely failed.</p>

                <h2>What a Technician Evaluates</h2>
                <p>A technician begins by running a diagnostic cycle and measuring water inlet flow to confirm the tub fills to the correct level. The spray arms are tested for free rotation and inspected nozzle-by-nozzle for blockages. The internal heating element is tested for continuity to confirm it is reaching operating temperature. The detergent dispenser mechanism is tested for reliable actuation at the correct point in the cycle sequence.</p>

                <p>If those components check out, attention moves to the wash pump. The technician measures motor current draw and listens to pump output — a worn impeller produces audibly weaker flow and reduced spray arm pressure. On machines with a separate circulation pump, that component is checked independently from the drain pump. After identifying the faulty component, it is replaced and the machine is run through a full cycle with a standard dish load to verify cleaning has been restored.</p>

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                <p><strong>Is cloudy glassware a sign the dishwasher is malfunctioning?</strong> Not necessarily. Permanent cloudiness on glassware is usually etching — microscopic surface damage from mineral deposits in hard water — which is irreversible and unrelated to dishwasher function. Dishes that are streaky or have visible food residue after a cycle indicate a cleaning system fault. Dishes that are clean but spotted with white residue indicate a rinsing or hard-water issue that rinse aid can address.</p>

                <p><strong>Why does the dishwasher clean well on some cycles but not others?</strong> Different cycles use different water temperatures, fill volumes, and wash durations. A quick or eco cycle uses cooler water and less time; if the machine has a marginal heating element or borderline water pressure, the problem appears only under these lower-energy conditions. Running a normal or heavy cycle may clean acceptably while the shorter cycles do not — a sign the underlying component is degraded but not yet fully failed.</p>

                <p><strong>Can I use vinegar to clean the spray arm nozzles?</strong> Yes. Soaking removed spray arms in white vinegar for 30 minutes dissolves calcium and mineral deposits effectively. Running a cup of white vinegar in a bowl on the bottom rack through a hot cycle also helps dissolve interior mineral buildup. This is appropriate regular maintenance in hard-water areas.</p>

                <p><strong>How long do spray arms and impellers typically last?</strong> Spray arms in areas with hard water typically develop significant mineral buildup within 5–8 years of regular use. The impeller follows a similar timeline, though wear rate depends on whether abrasive food debris frequently bypasses the filter. Keeping the filter clean extends impeller life considerably.</p>
