            <h1>Dishwasher Won't Drain: Causes &amp; Diagnosis</h1>
            <p class="hero-text">Standing water in the dishwasher tub after a cycle means something is blocking the drain path. The problem could be a failed pump, a clogged hose, or a stuck valve. The sections below explain each cause and what you can safely check before calling for service.</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section>
        <div class="container">
            <div class="content-body">
                <h2>Quick Answer</h2>
                <p>Standing water in the dishwasher tub after a cycle means the drain path is blocked at one of three points: the drain pump (failed to move water), the drain hose (kinked, blocked, or incorrectly routed), or the check valve (stuck closed by mineral deposits or debris). The most common single cause is a failed or obstructed drain pump. A newly installed garbage disposal with its knockout plug still in place is also a frequent and easily overlooked cause of sudden drain failure.</p>

                <h2>Common Causes</h2>
                <p><strong>Failed Drain Pump:</strong> The drain pump motor forces used wash water out through the drain hose at the end of each cycle. When the motor windings burn out, the impeller cracks, or the internal seal fails, the pump cannot move water regardless of how long the cycle runs. A humming sound during the drain phase with no water movement indicates the motor is energized but mechanically unable to pump — either from a seized bearing, a broken impeller, or a severe blockage jamming the impeller.</p>

                <p><strong>Clogged Drain Hose:</strong> Food particles, grease, and mineral deposits accumulate inside the corrugated drain hose over years of use. Blockages are most common at the low point of the hose or at connection points — where the hose attaches to the garbage disposal inlet or the sink drain. A hose kinked by the machine being pushed back against the cabinet wall has the same effect as a blockage: it cuts off flow completely.</p>

                <p><strong>Garbage Disposal Knockout Plug Not Removed:</strong> When a new garbage disposal is installed, a solid plastic plug seals the dishwasher inlet port on the disposal body. This plug must be knocked out before connecting the dishwasher drain hose. If it was left in place, the dishwasher drain hose connects to a sealed dead end. The machine drains normally until the disposal is replaced — then stops draining entirely. This is one of the most common causes of sudden drain failure following a kitchen appliance upgrade.</p>

                <p><strong>Stuck Check Valve:</strong> The check valve is a one-way flapper that allows water to exit the tub but prevents it from flowing back in. Mineral deposits — particularly common in Denver's hard water — can build up on the valve seat and prevent the flapper from opening. The drain pump may be running normally, but if the check valve won't open, water has nowhere to go.</p>

                <p><strong>Drain Solenoid Failure:</strong> Some dishwasher models use an electrically operated solenoid valve to initiate the drain cycle. If the solenoid fails to energize or its plunger seizes, the valve never opens and the drain phase is skipped entirely. This often appears alongside an error code on the display panel.</p>

                <h2>Checks You Can Do Yourself</h2>
                <p><strong>Listen during the drain phase:</strong> Run a short cycle and pay attention at the end. A healthy drain pump produces a clear whirring or buzzing sound for 60–90 seconds as it evacuates water. Silence during the drain phase indicates the pump motor is not receiving power or has seized. Humming without water movement indicates the motor is energized but mechanically stuck.</p>

                <p><strong>Check for a garbage disposal knockout plug:</strong> If drain failure started after a new garbage disposal was installed, this is the first thing to verify. Remove the rubber splash guard inside the disposal inlet and look for a solid plastic disk blocking the port. If present, it can be knocked out from inside the disposal with a screwdriver and hammer, then removed from the disposal drum before reconnecting the hose.</p>

                <p><strong>Inspect the drain hose for kinks:</strong> With the dishwasher unplugged, trace the drain hose path — typically accessible from the cabinet under the sink. The hose should follow a smooth path from the machine to the sink drain or disposal connection with no sharp bends or pinch points. A hose pushed hard against the cabinet back when the machine was last serviced is a common source of kinking.</p>

                <p><strong>Check the sink drain and disposal:</strong> If water backs up into the kitchen sink when the dishwasher runs, the blockage is downstream of the dishwasher — in the shared drain line, a clogged P-trap, or a full disposal. Running the disposal and then starting a drain cycle can clear a mild backup.</p>

                <p><strong>Note any error codes:</strong> Modern dishwashers display error codes when drain failure is detected. Write down any code and look it up in the owner's manual — codes frequently identify whether the fault is in the pump circuit, solenoid circuit, or control board, which guides the repair approach.</p>

                <h2>What NOT to Do</h2>
                <p>Do not run additional wash cycles when the tub already contains standing water. Each additional cycle fills the tub further; if the drain path is blocked, water will eventually overflow through the door seal onto the kitchen floor.</p>

                <p>Do not attempt to disassemble the drain pump housing or replace the pump motor without first unplugging the machine completely. The pump and its electrical connections sit in a wet environment; working on them with the machine plugged in creates a serious shock hazard.</p>

                <p>Do not tilt or tip the dishwasher to try to force water out. The tub, pump, and motor assembly are not designed to be handled at an angle, and tipping the machine can spill standing water into the motor and control board area.</p>

                <h2>When to Call a Professional</h2>
                <p>If the pump runs but water does not move — and the hose is not kinked and the disposal knockout plug has been removed — the pump impeller is likely broken or severely obstructed, requiring disassembly to access. If the pump is silent during the drain phase, the motor has likely failed and needs electrical testing to confirm before replacement. If an error code is present, the control board or solenoid requires diagnostic testing with a multimeter.</p>

                <p>Standing water that has been sitting in the tub for more than a few hours should be addressed promptly — stagnant water in a warm, enclosed tub creates conditions for mold and bacteria growth quickly.</p>

                <h2>What a Technician Evaluates</h2>
                <p>A technician begins by running the dishwasher through a drain cycle and listening to the pump — confirming whether it is energizing, and whether it is generating flow or turning against a mechanical obstruction. With the machine unplugged, the technician accesses the pump from below the tub and inspects the impeller for cracks, foreign object obstructions, and bearing play. The drain hose is traced from pump outlet to drain connection and checked for kinks, blockages, and proper high-loop routing.</p>

                <p>The check valve is removed and inspected for mineral fouling and flapper condition. If the machine has a drain solenoid, the technician applies test voltage directly to the solenoid and checks whether the valve opens. The pump motor windings are tested for continuity and resistance; a motor with open windings or out-of-specification resistance is replaced. After the repair, the technician runs two complete cycles to confirm the tub drains fully and no water remains at cycle end.</p>

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                <p><strong>Can I use the dishwasher if it has standing water in the tub?</strong> No. Adding another cycle to a tub that already contains standing water risks overflow through the door seal. Remove as much of the standing water as possible with towels or a wet-dry vacuum, and do not run the machine again until the drain fault is repaired.</p>

                <p><strong>Why did my dishwasher suddenly stop draining after a garbage disposal installation?</strong> The knockout plug inside the new disposal's dishwasher inlet port was almost certainly not removed before the drain hose was connected. This seals the connection completely. The fix is to remove the plug from inside the disposal — it does not require any dishwasher disassembly.</p>

                <p><strong>Can mineral buildup in the check valve cause complete drain failure?</strong> Yes. Calcium deposits from hard water can accumulate on the check valve seat to the point where the flapper cannot open even under full pump pressure. The valve may need to be cleaned with a descaling agent or, if fouling is severe, replaced entirely.</p>

                <p><strong>My dishwasher drains into a shared line with the sink — could a clogged sink cause this?</strong> Yes. If the shared drain line has a partial blockage from grease or food debris, backpressure can prevent the dishwasher from draining even if the dishwasher pump is functioning normally. Water backing up into the sink drain when the dishwasher runs is a reliable indicator that the blockage is downstream of both fixtures rather than inside the dishwasher itself.</p>
