            <h1>Why Is Your Refrigerator Leaking Water?</h1>
            <p class="hero-text">A leaking refrigerator demands quick attention — puddles on your kitchen floor can damage subfloors and cabinetry, while interior leaks can compromise food storage. Understanding the source is the first step toward a lasting fix.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="container">
            <div class="content-body">
                <h2>Quick Answer</h2>
                <p>Most refrigerator leaks originate from one of four sources: a clogged defrost drain (the most common cause, especially in units over five years old), a cracked or overflowing drain pan, a leaking water supply line at the back of the unit, or a failed door gasket that allows warm humid air to condense and pool inside. The location of the water — puddle under the unit, water inside the crisper drawers, or dripping from the back — is the most reliable first clue for narrowing down which component is failing.</p>

                <h2>Common Causes</h2>
                <p><strong>Clogged Defrost Drain:</strong> Every refrigerator runs automatic defrost cycles to melt frost off the evaporator coils. Meltwater is routed through a drain tube at the bottom of the freezer compartment down into a drain pan beneath the unit, where heat from the compressor causes it to evaporate. When this drain tube blocks — from accumulated ice crystals, food debris, or mineral sediment — meltwater has nowhere to go. It backs up into the freezer, pools at the base, and eventually overflows into the refrigerator section or leaks to the floor. This is the most common refrigerator leak source, particularly in units that have not been serviced recently.</p>

                <p><strong>Cracked or Overflowing Drain Pan:</strong> The drain pan is a shallow tray positioned directly beneath the refrigerator, accessible from the bottom front behind the kick plate. It collects defrost water and relies on the condenser fan blowing warm air across it to evaporate the water before the pan fills. If the pan has cracked from age or impact, it drains directly onto the floor. If the condenser fan has slowed or failed, the evaporation rate drops and the pan overflows even though it has no cracks.</p>

                <p><strong>Water Supply Line Leak:</strong> Refrigerators with ice makers or external water dispensers have a plastic supply line running from the home's water valve to the water inlet valve at the back of the unit. These lines can develop hairline cracks from age or freeze-thaw cycles. Loose fittings at either the wall connection or the inlet valve can weep continuously. Unlike defrost leaks that happen periodically, supply line leaks are constant and typically originate from the back of the unit.</p>

                <p><strong>Failed Door Gasket:</strong> The rubber gasket running around the perimeter of the refrigerator door creates an airtight seal when closed. A gasket that has dried out, cracked, or no longer compresses properly allows warm, humid air to enter the compartment continuously. This produces more condensation than the defrost drain can handle, leading to pooling inside the unit and eventual overflow toward the floor.</p>

                <h2>Checks You Can Do Yourself</h2>
                <p><strong>Inspect the defrost drain:</strong> Unplug the refrigerator. Locate the defrost drain opening — usually a small hole at the bottom rear interior of the freezer compartment, or accessible through a removable panel. Look inside with a flashlight. If the opening is blocked by ice or debris, try flushing it with warm (not boiling) water using a turkey baster or small syringe. If water flows through freely, the drain was clogged and clearing it may resolve the leak.</p>

                <p><strong>Check the drain pan:</strong> Remove the kick plate at the bottom front of the unit and look at the drain pan. Is it visibly cracked? Does it contain standing water suggesting the condenser fan is not evaporating it quickly enough? A cracked pan is a straightforward replacement. An overfull pan with no cracks points to condenser fan degradation.</p>

                <p><strong>Inspect the door gasket:</strong> With the door closed, look for gaps around the perimeter where you can see light. Close the door on a sheet of paper — it should hold the paper firmly when you try to pull it. If the paper slides out easily, the seal is compromised at that location. Also check whether the gasket feels pliable or has become hard and cracked.</p>

                <p><strong>Trace the supply line:</strong> If the refrigerator has an ice maker or dispenser, trace the water supply line from the wall shut-off valve along the back of the unit to the inlet valve. Look for visible cracks, kinks, or moisture around the fittings at each end. Gently check whether the connections feel tight or loose.</p>

                <h2>What NOT to Do</h2>
                <p>Do not use boiling water to clear a frozen defrost drain — the sudden temperature change can crack the plastic drain tube and make the problem worse. Use warm water only.</p>

                <p>Do not use wire, toothpicks, or sharp tools to probe the drain opening. These can puncture the drain tubing, creating a permanent leak where there was only a blockage.</p>

                <p>Do not attempt to remove internal components like the water inlet valve or evaporator coils without professional experience. These involve water under line pressure and electrical connections that present shock and flood risk if disturbed incorrectly.</p>

                <p>Always unplug the refrigerator before accessing the drain pan or working near the supply line connections at the back. If you detect any burning smell or unusual odor near the base of the unit, disconnect power immediately and do not investigate further.</p>

                <h2>When to Call a Professional</h2>
                <p>If the defrost drain remains clogged after a warm-water flush, the blockage is likely further down the drain tube where it cannot be reached from the interior. If the drain pan is cracked or the condenser fan has failed, those components need replacement. If the supply line has visible cracks or the inlet valve is leaking at the valve body itself, line pressure makes DIY repair unsafe. If the leak persists after addressing an obvious clog, the defrost thermostat or defrost heater may be failing — causing the coils to ice over repeatedly — requiring component testing to confirm.</p>

                <h2>What a Technician Evaluates</h2>
                <p>A technician begins with a systematic inspection to isolate the leak source: the defrost drain is tested for blockages and cleared or replaced if necessary; the drain pan is examined for cracks and proper positioning; the condenser fan is tested for correct operation and airflow; the water supply line is checked for moisture, cracks, and fitting security; and the door gasket is evaluated for seal compression around the full perimeter.</p>

                <p>If the defrost drain is repeatedly clogging, the technician may identify a defrost drain heater — a thin heating element that prevents ice formation in the drain tube — as a preventive addition. If the defrost timer or defrost thermostat is malfunctioning and causing the coils to over-frost, those control components are tested for continuity and replaced if needed. After completing repairs, the technician runs the unit through a defrost cycle to confirm the leak path has been eliminated before closing out the visit.</p>

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                <p><strong>Can a refrigerator leak cause mold or water damage to my home?</strong> Yes. Even modest-looking puddles can saturate subfloors, particleboard cabinetry, and wall bases, creating conditions for mold within 24–48 hours of water exposure. Prompt repair prevents damage that can become significantly more costly than the appliance repair itself.</p>

                <p><strong>Is a refrigerator leak always coming from the refrigerator itself?</strong> Not always. External humidity, an improperly leveled unit (refrigerators should tilt very slightly rearward so the door self-closes), or condensation from air conditioning vents above can contribute to pooling near the unit. Rule out external factors first by checking floor level and inspecting the area around the base.</p>

                <p><strong>Can the refrigerator still be used while it is leaking?</strong> Brief continued use is acceptable if the leak is slow and not affecting food storage. However, a clogged defrost drain causes internal ice accumulation that strains the compressor over time. For supply line leaks or any leak near electrical components, stop using the unit until it is repaired.</p>

                <p><strong>Will clearing a clogged drain prevent future leaks?</strong> Clearing the drain resolves the immediate symptom, but if the root cause — food debris entering the drain area, a failing defrost heater causing rapid ice accumulation, or a worn door gasket admitting excess humidity — is not addressed, the drain can reblock. A technician can identify which underlying condition is contributing and correct it to reduce recurrence.</p>
