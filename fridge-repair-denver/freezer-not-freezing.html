            <p class="hero-text">A freezer that fails to freeze or maintain proper temperature puts hundreds of dollars of food at risk within hours. Understanding the mechanical and electrical causes helps you decide whether the issue can be diagnosed safely at home.</p>

                <h2>Freezer Temperature Failure: Overview & Impact</h2>
                <p>A refrigerator with a working fresh-food section but a warm freezer compartment (or vice versa) indicates a failure in the refrigeration cycle's ability to deliver cold to one specific section. Food begins to thaw within 2–4 hours, bacteria multiply rapidly, and spoilage risk escalates significantly. Understanding whether the problem originates from the cooling system, airflow, or control mechanism helps determine urgency and repair approach.</p>

                <h2>Most Common Causes of Freezer Not Freezing</h2>
                <p><strong>Failed Compressor (Most Critical):</strong> The compressor is the heart of the refrigeration system—an electrically-powered pump that circulates refrigerant through the cooling coils. A compressor failure is the most serious and expensive freezer problem. When a compressor fails completely, it produces no cold at all; both compartments warm up. A compressor that is struggling or failing may produce weak cooling—the freezer reaches 20–30°F instead of 0°F, and the refrigerator becomes too cold or only moderately cool. Compressor failure is often preceded by warning signs: buzzing noises, the unit shutting off intermittently, or the motor humming but not circulating refrigerant.</p>

                <p><strong>Frozen Evaporator Coils (Most Common):</strong> The evaporator coils, located behind a wall panel in the freezer compartment, are where the refrigerant releases cold. If the defrost drain (which prevents frost accumulation on these coils) becomes clogged with ice or debris, the coils accumulate heavy frost. Eventually, a thick layer of ice completely blocks the coils, stopping cold from reaching either compartment—the freezer warms up, and as a side effect, the refrigerator often becomes too cold because what little cold is produced goes there. This is the single most common cause of a failing freezer in the 5–15 year age range.</p>

                <p><strong>Defrost Thermostat Failure:</strong> The defrost cycle automatically runs every 6–12 hours to melt frost off the evaporator coils, preventing ice buildup. A defrost thermostat monitors coil temperature and triggers the defrost cycle when frost accumulates. If the thermostat fails—reading incorrectly or not signaling defrost to start—the coils ice up unchecked. Over days, the ice layer grows until it blocks cooling completely.</p>

                <p><strong>Airflow Obstruction in Vents:</strong> Cold air produced in the evaporator coils is distributed to the freezer and refrigerator compartments through insulated ducts and vents. If these vents become blocked by food packages, ice buildup, or debris, cold air cannot reach one or both compartments. A partially blocked vent might reduce freezer temperature slightly; a fully blocked vent prevents any cold from reaching that area.</p>

                <p><strong>Failed Expansion Valve or Capillary Tube:</strong> The expansion valve (or capillary tube in older models) meters refrigerant into the evaporator coils. If it sticks closed or becomes clogged, insufficient refrigerant flows to the coils, resulting in weak or no cooling. This produces symptoms similar to a weak compressor: both compartments warm up gradually.</p>

                <p><strong>Low Refrigerant (Leak):</strong> A refrigerant leak—from a cracked line, failed connection, or corrosion—causes the system to lose cooling power gradually. Over days or weeks, cooling weakens until it's insufficient to freeze. Refrigerant leaks are serious and require professional repair; they cannot be fixed with DIY refilling.</p>

                <h2>Safe Checks You Can Perform</h2>
                <p><strong>1. Assess Both Compartments:</strong> Check the temperature of both the freezer and refrigerator sections. If ONLY the freezer is warm and the refrigerator is cold or cold enough, the problem is likely airflow blockage or a freezer-specific control issue. If BOTH compartments are warm, the compressor may have failed or refrigerant is critically low.</p>

                <p><strong>2. Listen and Feel for Motor Activity:</strong> With the refrigerator running, place your hand on the back exterior wall (the condenser area) or listen near the compressor area. You should feel slight warmth and may hear a faint hum from the compressor. If you hear nothing and feel no warmth, the compressor may not be running. A loud buzzing or grinding sound suggests the compressor is struggling.</p>

                <p><strong>3. Check for Ice Buildup Behind Freezer Wall:</strong> If your freezer has a removable wall panel or if you can see into the back, look for visible ice accumulation on the evaporator coil area. Heavy frost or ice suggests the defrost system is failing. Light frost is normal; thick ice is not.</p>

                <p><strong>4. Inspect Freezer Vents:**  Look inside the freezer compartment for small openings or vents that deliver cold air. Are they clear, or is food blocking them? Move any items obstructing vents and wait 2–4 hours. If temperature improves, the problem was airflow blockage.</p>

                <p><strong>5. Check the Defrost Drain:**  Locate the defrost drain (usually a small opening or tube at the back bottom of the fridge). Is it clear, or is it frozen/blocked? If you can safely access it without disassembly, try flushing with warm water. If it remains blocked, the drain line is clogged.</p>

                <h2>What NOT to Do — Safety First</h2>
                <p>Do not attempt to recharge refrigerant yourself—refrigerant is pressurized and dangerous to handle without proper equipment and certification. Do not use a hair dryer or heat gun to melt ice off frozen evaporator coils; you risk damaging plastic components or causing electrical hazards. Do not force or pry open sealed compressor connections or refrigerant lines—this releases refrigerant (an ozone-depleting substance in older systems) and creates a dangerous leak. Do not leave the unit unplugged for extended periods hoping the problem resolves—frozen coils need active defrosting; simply thawing passively can take days and wastes food. Do not ignore a loudly buzzing or grinding compressor; continued operation may cause internal damage and fire risk.</p>

                <h2>When Professional Help Is Necessary</h2>
                <p>If both compartments are warm, if you hear the compressor buzzing or struggling, if the freezer remains warm after clearing vent blockages, if you suspect a refrigerant leak (indicated by gradual cooling loss), or if the defrost drain cannot be cleared, professional diagnosis is essential. Compressor, expansion valve, and refrigerant-related repairs require specialized tools and EPA certification. A technician can diagnose the exact failure point and recommend repair or replacement.</p>

                <h2>What a Technician Usually Checks & Repairs</h2>
                <p>A technician begins by testing the compressor—confirming it's running and checking refrigerant pressure with a gauge to determine if pressure is normal, low (indicating a leak or clogged expansion valve), or absent (indicating compressor failure or a major leak). They inspect the evaporator coils for frost or ice buildup and assess the defrost cycle components. They verify airflow through vents and check for blockages. If the compressor is faulty, it's typically replaced (1–2 hours, depending on model and accessibility). If the evaporator coils are iced up, the defrost system is diagnosed and the stuck thermostat or heating element is replaced. If a refrigerant leak is found, the leak location is identified, the system is evacuated, the leak is repaired, and refrigerant is recharged according to system specifications. Most freezer repair visits result in a clear diagnosis and next steps for repair or replacement.</p>

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                <p><strong>Q: If my freezer is warm, is my compressor definitely dead?</strong><br>
A: Not necessarily. A weak compressor, clogged expansion valve, low refrigerant from a leak, frozen evaporator coils, or a blocked vent can all produce the same symptom. Professional testing with a refrigerant gauge and thermostat check is needed for diagnosis.</p>

                <p><strong>Q: Can a frozen evaporator coil unfreeze on its own?</strong><br>
A: Yes, if you manually activate the defrost cycle or unplug the unit for several hours. However, if the defrost system's thermostat is broken, the ice will reaccumulate immediately when the unit restarts. Addressing the underlying defrost system failure prevents recurrence.</p>

                <p><strong>Q: How much does it cost to replace a compressor?</strong><br>
A: Compressor replacement ranges widely—typically $600–$1,500+ depending on refrigerator age, model, and local labor rates. For older units, this cost often exceeds the value of the appliance, making replacement more economical.</p>

                <p><strong>Q: Will leaving the freezer door open help it get colder?</strong><br>
A: No. Leaving the door open prevents the thermostat from shutting off the cooling cycle, which can actually strain the compressor further and make the problem worse.</p>

                <p><strong>Q: Is it safe to keep food in a warming freezer while waiting for repair?</strong><br>
A: Only temporarily. If the freezer is above 40°F for more than 2 hours, food safety risk rises sharply. Either schedule repair urgently or relocate frozen items to a working freezer or cooler with ice.</p>

                <p><strong>Q: Can a weak freezer be "fixed" by adjusting the thermostat dial?</strong><br>
A: Adjusting the dial may temporarily help if the thermostat is slightly miscalibrated, but it won't fix underlying mechanical failures like a clogged defrost system or weak compressor. If turning the dial has no effect, the problem is mechanical.</p>

                <p><strong>Q: Why does my freezer ice up so quickly now when it didn't before?</strong><br>
A: Aging evaporator coil components (the thermostat or heating element) may be failing, preventing proper defrost cycles. A door seal failing can also allow humidity in, accelerating frost formation.</p>
