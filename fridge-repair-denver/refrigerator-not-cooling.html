            <h1>Why Isn't Your Refrigerator Cooling?</h1>
            <p class="hero-text">When a refrigerator stops cooling, the cause can range from a simple frost buildup on the evaporator coils to a serious compressor failure. Understanding which component is failing helps you determine urgency and next steps.</p>

                <h2>Refrigerator Cooling Failure: Overview & Urgency</h2>
                <p>A refrigerator that no longer maintains safe temperatures puts food at risk and requires prompt attention. Cooling failure can develop suddenly (compressor failure, start relay giving out) or gradually (evaporator fan wearing out, defrost system malfunctioning). Understanding where in the refrigeration cycle the failure is occurring guides your response and helps determine whether the issue can wait for a scheduled repair or demands urgent attention to prevent food spoilage.</p>

                <h2>Most Common Causes of Refrigerator Not Cooling</h2>
                <p><strong>Failed or Failing Defrost System (Most Common):</strong> Modern refrigerators use an automatic defrost cycle to periodically melt frost from the evaporator coils, preventing ice buildup that blocks airflow. This system includes a defrost heater (electric element), a defrost thermostat (sensor), and a defrost timer or control board. When one component fails—the heater stops working, the thermostat sticks, or the timer refuses to cycle defrost—frost accumulates rapidly on the coils. A thick ice layer blocks cold air from reaching the refrigerator compartment. The freezer may still feel cold, but the fridge compartment warms significantly.</p>

                <p><strong>Evaporator Fan Motor Failure:</strong> The evaporator fan sits behind the freezer back panel and circulates cold air from the evaporator coils into the refrigerator and freezer compartments. A burned-out motor or a fan blade blocked by ice stops air circulation entirely. Even though the coils may be producing cold, that cold air never reaches the food storage area. The refrigerator warms while the compressor continues cycling, unable to improve the temperature.</p>

                <p><strong>Compressor Weak or Failing:</strong> The compressor is the system's heart, circulating refrigerant under pressure through the coils to transfer heat. A weak compressor may run constantly but produce insufficient pressure to adequately cool the evaporator coils. Symptoms include the compressor humming but the fridge not reaching the set temperature. Complete compressor failure stops refrigerant circulation entirely—both compartments warm up and the compressor may refuse to start or shuts down intermittently due to overheating.</p>

                <p><strong>Refrigerant Leak:</strong> A crack in the evaporator coil, condenser coil, or connecting tubing allows pressurized refrigerant to escape. Cooling capacity decreases gradually as the refrigerant level drops. The compressor works harder to compensate, but over time (days to weeks) the cooling becomes insufficient. A severe leak can cause rapid cooling loss.</p>

                <p><strong>Faulty Start Relay or Overload Protector:</strong> The start relay provides a high-voltage jolt to the compressor motor to initiate operation. The overload protector cuts power if the compressor draws excessive current (preventing burnout). A failed relay prevents the compressor from starting—you hear a faint click but no compressor hum. An overload protector stuck in the open position shuts down the compressor prematurely, causing cycling off and on with no cooling achieved.</p>

                <p><strong>Dirty or Blocked Condenser Coils:</strong> The condenser coil (usually at the back or bottom of the refrigerator) releases heat from the refrigerant to the surrounding air. If dust, lint, or debris coats the coils, heat transfer is blocked. The compressor must work harder and longer to dissipate heat, and if the blockage is severe, the compressor overheats and shuts down via the overload protector. The result is insufficient cooling and possible compressor shutdown.</p>

                <p><strong>Temperature Control Thermostat or Sensor Failure:</strong> The thermostat (or electronic sensor) tells the compressor when to cycle on and off based on the set temperature. A failed thermostat may tell the compressor to stop cycling even though the food compartment is warm, or it may cause constant cycling without reaching the desired temperature. Some failures cause the compressor to never start.</p>

                <h2>Safe Checks You Can Perform</h2>
                <p><strong>1. Check Both Compartment Temperatures:</strong> Use a thermometer in both the freezer and refrigerator (not on the door). Note the readings. If ONLY the fridge is warm and the freezer is still cold or has frost buildup, the problem is likely airflow (evaporator fan) or the defrost system icing up. If BOTH compartments are warm, the compressor or refrigerant may be the issue.</p>

                <p><strong>2. Listen and Feel for Compressor Activity:</strong> With the door closed, place your hand on the back exterior wall (near the compressor area). You should feel slight warmth and possibly a faint hum. If you feel nothing and hear no hum, the compressor is not running. If you hear a faint click but no hum, the start relay may be failing. A loud buzzing or grinding sound indicates a struggling compressor.</p>

                <p><strong>3. Inspect for Frost or Ice Buildup on Freezer Back Panel:</strong> If your freezer has a removable back panel or viewing window, check the evaporator coil area. Light frost is normal. Heavy frost or thick ice indicates a defrost system failure—the coils are icing up and blocking airflow.</p>

                <p><strong>4. Clean the Condenser Coils:</strong> Locate the condenser coil (usually at the back or underneath the refrigerator). Dust and lint covering the coil reduces cooling efficiency. Unplug the refrigerator, use a brush or vacuum with a soft brush attachment to gently clean the coils, and plug it back in. Wait a few hours and check if cooling improves. If it does, clogged condenser coils were the issue.</p>

                <p><strong>5. Check Thermostat Settings and Reset:</strong> Verify the thermostat dial or digital display is set to a cooling position (not "off"). Try adjusting it to a colder setting and wait 4–6 hours. If cooling resumes, the thermostat may have been misadjusted. If adjusting makes no difference, the thermostat may have failed.</p>

                <h2>What NOT to Do — Safety First</h2>
                <p>Do not attempt to recharge or tamper with refrigerant lines—refrigerant is pressurized, toxic, and ozone-depleting in older systems. Handling requires EPA certification. Do not ignore a loud buzzing or grinding compressor—continued operation can cause internal damage and fire risk from electrical overload. Do not block condenser coils to stop the compressor from running; this makes the problem worse. Do not disassemble the compressor or sealed system components without proper tools and training. Do not leave food in a warming refrigerator indefinitely—food safety risk increases significantly above 40°F after 2 hours.</p>

                <h2>When Professional Help Is Necessary</h2>
                <p>If both compartments are warm, if you observe no compressor activity (no sound, no vibration, no warmth), or if the refrigerator continues failing after cleaning the condenser coils and adjusting the thermostat, professional diagnosis is essential. Compressor failure, refrigerant leaks, and sealed-system repairs require specialized tools and EPA-certified technicians. A warm defrost system component is also best diagnosed and repaired by a professional to ensure the correct part is replaced.</p>

                <h2>What a Technician Usually Checks & Repairs</h2>
                <p>A technician begins by measuring temperatures in both compartments and observing compressor operation (listening for motor activity, checking for power delivery). They inspect the evaporator coil area for frost or ice accumulation and test the defrost heater and thermostat with an electrical meter to confirm they are functioning. They check refrigerant pressure with a gauge—low pressure indicates a possible leak. They test the start relay by observing if it clicks when the compressor tries to start. They inspect the condenser coils for blockage and clean if necessary. If the compressor is running but cooling is weak, they check for electrical draw and listen for unusual sounds inside the compressor. Common repairs include replacing the defrost heater, defrost thermostat, defrost control board, evaporator fan motor, start relay, or temperature thermostat. If the compressor itself is faulty or there is a significant refrigerant leak, the technician discusses repair vs. replacement options. Most cooling-related repairs are diagnosed and completed in 1–2 hours, though compressor replacement may take longer.</p>

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                <p><strong>Q: If my refrigerator is warm but the freezer is cold, is the problem serious?</strong><br>
A: Not necessarily critical, but it requires prompt attention. If only the fridge is warm while the freezer is cold, the problem is typically airflow-related (failed evaporator fan) or the defrost system is icing up the coils. Both are repairable but should not be delayed.</p>

                <p><strong>Q: Will my food spoil if I leave it in a warm refrigerator?</strong><br>
A: Yes. Once the refrigerator temperature rises above 40°F, bacteria multiply rapidly. After 2 hours at temperatures above 40°F, perishable items (meat, dairy, prepared foods) should be discarded. Plan to schedule repair or relocate food to a working fridge or cooler immediately.</p>

                <p><strong>Q: If the condenser coils are dirty, can I clean them myself?</strong><br>
A: Possibly. Most homeowners can vacuum condenser coils with a soft brush attachment, which often improves cooling if blockage is the issue. However, if cooling does not improve after cleaning, the problem is internal and requires professional diagnosis.</p>

                <p><strong>Q: What does it mean if my compressor hums but the fridge doesn't cool?</strong><br>
A: The compressor is running but not effectively cooling. This could indicate low refrigerant from a leak, a weak compressor, an iced-up evaporator coil (defrost system failure), a failed evaporator fan motor, or a faulty thermostat. Professional diagnosis is needed to pinpoint the cause.</p>

                <p><strong>Q: Is a weak refrigerator something I can ignore if it's still keeping food somewhat cold?</strong><br>
A: No. A weak refrigerator that struggles to maintain safe temperature indicates a developing failure. Early diagnosis and repair can prevent complete breakdown and food loss. Continuing to operate a marginally cooling unit strains the compressor and can lead to sudden failure.</p>

                <p><strong>Q: How often should I clean the condenser coils?</strong><br>
A: Most manufacturers recommend cleaning the condenser coils every 6 months, especially if you have pets, live in a dusty environment, or the refrigerator is located in a kitchen with high cooking activity. Regular cleaning extends compressor life and maintains efficient cooling.</p>

                <p><strong>Q: Can a refrigerator stop cooling overnight, or does it always develop gradually?</strong><br>
A: Both are possible. A defrost heater or start relay can fail suddenly, causing cooling to stop within hours. A refrigerant leak or evaporator fan wear typically develops more gradually over days or weeks. Rapid onset usually points to an electrical component failure; gradual onset often indicates mechanical wear.</p>
