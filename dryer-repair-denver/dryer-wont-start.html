            <h1>Why Won't My Dryer Start?</h1>
            <p class="hero-text">A dryer that doesn't respond when you press start has an interruption somewhere in its electrical or mechanical start circuit. The causes range from simple power supply issues to failed internal components. This guide explains the most common reasons, what you can check safely without tools, and what a technician evaluates during a professional diagnosis.</p>

                <h2>Recognizing the Symptom Pattern</h2>
                <p>How the dryer fails to start provides important diagnostic information before any panel is removed. Two distinct categories cover most no-start situations.</p>

                <p><strong>Completely unresponsive — no lights, no sounds, no drum movement:</strong> The machine is receiving no power, or an internal circuit has been fully interrupted. Check the circuit breaker first. If power is confirmed at the outlet, a blown thermal fuse is the most likely cause on most dryer models — it cuts all power to the machine, not just the heating circuit.</p>

                <p><strong>Partially responsive — display or timer works, but the cycle won't initiate:</strong> The machine has power and the controls appear functional, but pressing start produces nothing or only a momentary hum. This category most commonly points to a door switch failure — the control board won't allow the motor to run because it isn't receiving a confirmed signal that the door is closed. A failed start switch or motor are also in this category.</p>

                <p><strong>Hums briefly but drum doesn't turn:</strong> The motor is receiving power and attempting to start, but something is mechanically preventing rotation. A seized drum bearing, a broken belt paired with a belt switch, or a motor with a failed start winding can all produce this symptom.</p>

                <p><strong>Trips the circuit breaker on start attempt:</strong> A direct short circuit inside the dryer — most commonly in the motor, heating element, or wiring — is pulling more current than the circuit can safely carry. This requires diagnosis before the dryer is used again.</p>

                <h2>Most Common Causes of a Dryer That Won't Start</h2>
                <p><strong>Failed Door Switch:</strong> Every dryer includes a safety interlock that prevents operation unless the door is securely closed. A small plunger-style switch in the door frame sends a confirmation signal to the control board when the door latch presses it. When this switch fails — due to worn or corroded contacts, a broken plunger, or a cracked housing — the control board receives no "door closed" signal and will not allow the motor to engage, regardless of whether the door appears fully shut from the outside.</p>

                <p>Door switch failure can be sudden or progressive. A switch that is partially failing may work intermittently — the dryer starts on some attempts but not others, or requires pressing the door firmly closed with more force than usual. Consistent no-start behavior with an apparently closed door is the most common presentation of full switch failure. This is the single most frequent cause of a dryer that won't start with no prior warning.</p>

                <p><strong>Blown Thermal Fuse:</strong> The thermal fuse is a one-time safety component positioned on the blower housing or exhaust duct. If the dryer reaches a temperature high enough to trigger it, the fuse permanently interrupts the circuit to prevent a fire hazard. Unlike a circuit breaker, it cannot reset — once blown, it must be physically replaced.</p>

                <p>On many dryer models, a blown thermal fuse cuts power to the entire machine, not just the heating element. The result is a dryer that is completely unresponsive — no display, no timer movement, no drum rotation. The fuse itself is inexpensive, but replacing it without correcting the overheating root cause (almost always a restricted exhaust vent or failed cycling thermostat) means the new fuse will blow again under the same conditions.</p>

                <p><strong>Failed Start Switch:</strong> The start button on a dryer is a momentary-contact switch — it sends voltage to the motor only while being actively pressed, after which the motor's run circuit takes over. When the internal contacts of the start switch wear out or corrode, pressing the button no longer completes the circuit, and no signal reaches the motor. The control board and all other functions may work normally. This is common on older dryers where the start button has been pressed thousands of times.</p>

                <p><strong>Drive Motor Failure:</strong> The drive motor turns the drum and powers the blower wheel simultaneously. Motor failures present differently depending on which part of the motor has failed. A motor with a failed start winding will hum when start is pressed but won't rotate — it is attempting to start but cannot generate the torque to overcome inertia. A motor with a burned-out run winding may not respond at all. A motor with seized bearings will not rotate and may trip the thermal overload protector built into the motor itself.</p>

                <p><strong>Broken Drum Belt and Belt Switch:</strong> The drum on most residential dryers is driven by a thin flat belt looped around the drum and through an idler pulley to the motor. When this belt breaks, the drum stops turning. On dryers equipped with a belt switch, a broken belt also triggers a safety interlock that prevents the motor from running — a measure to prevent the motor from spinning freely at high speed with no load. If your model has this switch, a broken belt causes a no-start condition that looks identical to other electrical failures until the belt is visually inspected.</p>

                <p><strong>Control Board Failure:</strong> The electronic control board manages all dryer functions and sequences motor operation, heating, and timing. If a relay on the board fails — particularly the relay controlling motor power — pressing start produces no response even when all other components are functioning. Control board failures sometimes follow power surges. They may also be preceded by erratic behavior: cycles ending unexpectedly, error codes, or intermittent no-start events that then become permanent.</p>

                <h2>Checks You Can Do Yourself</h2>
                <p><strong>Check the Circuit Breaker:</strong> Electric dryers run on a 240-volt circuit served by a double-pole breaker in the electrical panel. A tripped breaker sits in the middle position — neither fully on nor off. To reset it, switch it fully to the off position, then back to on. If the breaker trips immediately upon restoration of power, there is an active electrical fault inside the dryer and the machine should not be used until the fault is identified.</p>

                <p>Note that electric dryers use two 120-volt legs to create 240 volts. If one leg is lost — due to a partial breaker failure or a loose connection at the terminal block — the dryer may have power to some components (such as the interior light or controls) but not enough to run the motor. This can present as a dryer that appears to have power but won't start a cycle.</p>

                <p><strong>Test the Door Latch:</strong> Open and close the dryer door slowly. A functioning latch should produce a firm, definite click as the door closes and the latch engages. A door that closes but doesn't click solidly, that feels loose when shut, or that springs slightly back when released likely has a worn latch mechanism that isn't fully pressing the door switch. Look at the latch assembly — visible cracks in the plastic housing or a visibly loose catch are signs of mechanical latch failure.</p>

                <p><strong>Check for a Child Lock or Control Lock:</strong> Some dryer models include a control lock feature that disables all buttons. Check your model's manual or the display panel for a lock indicator. Control lock is typically deactivated by pressing and holding a specific button combination for 3–5 seconds.</p>

                <p><strong>Verify the Outlet:</strong> If the dryer is plugged into a wall outlet rather than hardwired, confirm the outlet has power by plugging in a lamp or phone charger. If the outlet has no power despite the breaker being in the on position, the outlet itself or the wiring to it may have a fault. Gas dryers use a standard 120-volt outlet; electric dryers use a 240-volt outlet that requires a specific multi-prong plug.</p>

                <h2>Safety — What Not to Do</h2>
                <p>Do not attempt to bypass the door switch in order to force the dryer to run with the door open. The door interlock exists to prevent the drum and heating element from operating with the door open. Bypassing it is both a burn hazard and a fire risk from exposed heat and tumbling items.</p>

                <p>Do not repeatedly reset a circuit breaker that trips when the dryer is powered. A breaker that trips on restoration indicates an active short circuit or ground fault inside the appliance. Repeated resets without identifying the fault can cause wiring damage, insulation failure, and overheating at the connection point.</p>

                <p>Do not work on any internal components — removing panels, disconnecting wiring, testing parts — while the dryer is plugged in or connected to its circuit. Dryer interiors contain capacitors and wiring that can carry lethal voltage. Always unplug or switch off the dedicated circuit breaker before touching any internal component. Confirm power is off with a non-contact voltage tester before proceeding.</p>

                <h2>When to Seek Professional Diagnosis</h2>
                <p>If you've confirmed power at the outlet, checked the circuit breaker, verified the door latch feels solid and clicks firmly, deactivated any control lock — and the dryer still won't start — the problem is internal and requires component-level testing. Testing the door switch, thermal fuse, start switch, and motor all require a multimeter and in most cases partial disassembly of the control panel or front cabinet.</p>

                <p>Seek professional diagnosis when: the circuit breaker is fine but the dryer is completely unresponsive; the door latches firmly but the dryer still won't start; the dryer hums when start is pressed but the drum doesn't turn; the circuit breaker trips immediately on a start attempt; or a power surge or overheating event preceded the failure.</p>

                <h2>What a Technician Evaluates</h2>
                <p>A technician evaluating a dryer that won't start begins by confirming voltage at the terminal block or outlet — specifically verifying both legs of a 240-volt supply are present for electric dryers. With power confirmed, the door switch is tested for continuity with the door closed and open. A switch that reads closed regardless of door position, or open in both positions, has failed and needs replacement.</p>

                <p>The thermal fuse is tested next for continuity. A fuse that reads open circuit confirms it has blown and requires replacement. Because a blown thermal fuse often indicates a prior overheat event, the technician also evaluates the exhaust vent system and cycling thermostat to identify what caused the overheating before replacing the fuse alone.</p>

                <p>If the door switch and thermal fuse are intact, the start switch is tested under load — verifying it closes the motor circuit when pressed and opens when released. The drive motor is tested for resistance across its windings and for a seized bearing condition (drum should rotate freely by hand with the belt removed). On models with a belt switch, the belt is inspected visually and the switch is tested for continuity with the belt intact and broken.</p>

                <p>Control board evaluation comes last, as it is the most complex step and is reached only after simpler components have been eliminated. The technician looks for burned relays, damaged solder joints, or components with visible heat damage, and may test control output signals during a start attempt.</p>

                <p>Common repairs: door switch replacement; thermal fuse replacement (paired with vent system correction); start switch replacement; drum belt and belt switch replacement; drive motor replacement; control board replacement. Door switch, thermal fuse, start switch, and belt repairs are typically quick single-visit repairs. Motor and control board replacements take longer but are also completed in a single visit for most common models.</p>

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                <p><strong>My dryer interior light turns on but it won't start — what does that indicate?</strong> An interior light with no start response confirms the machine has some power. For electric dryers, this may mean one of the two 120-volt power legs is present but the other is not — the light circuit only needs one leg, but the motor needs both. Check the circuit breaker carefully for a partial trip. If both legs are confirmed present, the most likely cause is a failed door switch or start switch.</p>

                <p><strong>Can a power surge cause a dryer to stop starting?</strong> Yes. Surges can blow the internal thermal fuse (completely disabling the machine), damage the control board's relay circuitry, or in rare cases damage the start switch. After any power surge or electrical storm event, check the circuit breaker first. If the breaker is fine but the dryer is dead, the thermal fuse is the highest-priority component to test — it's a common surge casualty and an inexpensive repair.</p>

                <p><strong>My dryer was working fine and then just stopped starting with no warning — is that normal?</strong> Sudden failures are common with door switches, thermal fuses, and start switches. These components operate in a binary fashion — they work until they don't. A door switch may provide years of reliable service before a contact wears through completely. A thermal fuse is a one-time device that gives no warning before blowing. Gradual failures (intermittent starting, requiring extra effort to engage) tend to precede full failure in door switches and start switches, but often the change is subtle enough to go unnoticed until complete failure occurs.</p>

                <p><strong>My dryer hums when I press start but the drum doesn't turn — is the motor bad?</strong> Not necessarily. A humming motor attempting to start but failing to rotate can indicate a motor with a failed start winding, but it can also indicate a mechanically seized drum, a broken idler pulley that is preventing belt tension, or a jammed blower wheel. Before concluding the motor has failed, a technician will verify the drum rotates freely by hand (with power off and belt removed) to rule out mechanical binding as the cause. A motor that can't start due to mechanical resistance will be damaged further by continued start attempts.</p>
