            <h1>Why Is My Dryer Overheating?</h1>
            <p class="hero-text">An overheating dryer is a genuine fire hazard, not just a performance issue. This guide explains the mechanical and electrical causes behind excessive dryer heat, what you can safely inspect on your own, and the warning signs that indicate the dryer should not be used until it has been properly evaluated.</p>

                <h2>Recognizing the Symptoms</h2>
                <p>Overheating dryers present in several ways, and identifying the specific symptom helps narrow down the cause before any disassembly takes place.</p>

                <p><strong>Clothes come out with scorch marks, brown spots, or a burned smell:</strong> The drum temperature is consistently exceeding safe limits. This is the most direct sign of uncontrolled heat. Synthetic fabrics are most vulnerable and will show damage before cotton does.</p>

                <p><strong>The dryer cabinet exterior is extremely hot to the touch:</strong> Some warmth is normal, but the top or sides should not be painful to rest your hand on during a cycle. Excessive exterior heat indicates the internal temperature is well above the designed operating range of 125–135°F.</p>

                <p><strong>The dryer shuts itself off mid-cycle and won't restart until it cools:</strong> This is a triggered high-limit thermostat or thermal cutoff doing its job — it has detected dangerous heat and interrupted the circuit. The underlying cause driving those temperatures still needs to be found.</p>

                <p><strong>The thermal fuse has blown more than once:</strong> A thermal fuse is a one-time device. If it has needed replacement more than once in a year, the root cause (usually blocked airflow) was never corrected, and the cycle will repeat.</p>

                <p><strong>The laundry room becomes unusually warm during operation:</strong> Some heat radiating from the dryer is normal, but a noticeably hot room suggests heat is escaping from the dryer cabinet or vent system rather than being properly exhausted outside.</p>

                <h2>Most Common Causes of a Dryer Overheating</h2>
                <p><strong>Clogged or Restricted Exhaust Vent:</strong> This is the leading cause of dryer overheating and also the leading cause of dryer fires. The dryer is engineered to push hot, moisture-laden air out through an exhaust duct to the exterior of the home. When lint accumulates inside the vent line, or when the duct is kinked, crushed, or runs longer than manufacturer specifications allow, the hot air has nowhere to go. It backs up into the dryer cabinet, causing internal temperatures to climb far above the normal operating range. Lint inside the duct is highly flammable, and the combination of trapped heat and accumulated lint creates a serious fire risk.</p>

                <p>Vent restrictions build gradually over time. A partially blocked vent may not cause obvious problems for months, but the cumulative heat stress on thermostats and the heating element accelerates their failure. Regular vent cleaning is the most effective preventive measure against dryer overheating.</p>

                <p><strong>Failed Cycling Thermostat:</strong> The cycling thermostat monitors air temperature inside the drum and cycles the heating element on and off to maintain a consistent target temperature. When this thermostat fails in the closed position — meaning it no longer opens when the set temperature is reached — the heating element runs continuously without interruption. The drum temperature climbs unchecked until either the high-limit thermostat intervenes or the thermal fuse blows. A cycling thermostat failure is fully electrical and cannot be identified through visual inspection; it requires testing with a multimeter.</p>

                <p><strong>Failed High-Limit Thermostat:</strong> The high-limit thermostat is a separate safety component positioned on the heating element housing or exhaust duct. It is designed to cut power to the heating element if temperatures exceed a maximum safe threshold — it is the backup to the cycling thermostat. When the high-limit thermostat fails to open at its rated temperature, there is no longer a secondary safeguard against runaway heat. In many cases, a high-limit failure follows a period of operation with a restricted vent, which caused the thermostat to trip so frequently that its contacts eventually wore out.</p>

                <p><strong>Shorted Heating Element (Electric Dryers):</strong> The heating element is a coiled wire that becomes resistive when energized, generating heat. Over years of thermal expansion and contraction, sections of the coil can sag and make contact with the metal housing surrounding it. This creates a ground fault — a path for current to flow even when the thermostat has opened the control circuit. The result is a heating element that stays energized regardless of what the thermostats signal. This failure mode can be detected with a continuity test between the element terminals and the element housing.</p>

                <p><strong>Worn or Torn Drum Felt Seals:</strong> Felt seals run along the front and rear edges of the drum, forming a boundary between the tumbling drum and the dryer cabinet. Their purpose is to direct airflow through the drum and out through the exhaust path. When these seals wear through or tear, heated air escapes around the drum edges and concentrates inside the cabinet rather than following the designed airflow path. This can cause localized overheating near the drum edges and scorching of clothing that makes contact with the drum rim.</p>

                <h2>Checks You Can Do Yourself</h2>
                <p><strong>Inspect and Clean the Lint Screen:</strong> The lint screen should be cleaned before every load — not once a week. A clogged lint screen reduces airflow through the entire system. Pull the screen out, remove accumulated lint by hand, and if fabric softener residue has built up on the mesh (causing it to feel stiff or block water during a faucet test), wash it with warm soapy water and a soft brush, then let it dry fully before reinstalling.</p>

                <p><strong>Inspect the Exhaust Duct for Kinks or Crushing:</strong> Pull the dryer away from the wall and examine the exhaust duct — the flexible or rigid pipe running from the back of the dryer to the wall. Flexible foil or vinyl duct is particularly prone to kinking or being compressed when the dryer is pushed too close to the wall. Any kink or crush point significantly restricts airflow. Rigid metal duct is preferable to flexible duct and maintains its shape over time.</p>

                <p><strong>Check the Exterior Vent Flap:</strong> Go outside and locate where the dryer exhausts (usually a wall vent near the dryer's exterior wall). With the dryer running, the flap should open freely and you should feel a strong, steady stream of warm air. A flap that barely opens, flaps slowly, or shows little airflow indicates a restriction somewhere in the duct line — either lint buildup in the duct itself or a blockage at the exterior hood.</p>

                <p><strong>Verify Vent Run Length:</strong> Most dryer manufacturers specify a maximum exhaust duct length, typically 25 feet of straight rigid duct, with each 90-degree elbow counting as 5 additional feet. If your vent run is close to or exceeds this length, airflow is inherently limited and the dryer is working harder than designed. This is a common situation in homes where the dryer is far from an exterior wall.</p>

                <h2>Safety — Stop Using the Dryer If:</h2>
                <p>An overheating dryer is not a problem that can safely wait. You should stop using the dryer immediately and unplug it (or switch off its circuit breaker) if any of the following are present:</p>

                <p>Clothes are coming out with scorch marks or a burned smell after any cycle. Scorched fabric means the drum temperature is reaching levels that ignite or degrade material, and lint inside the machine or duct faces the same risk. The dryer is shutting off mid-cycle from heat — the safety system has engaged, but the root cause is still present. There is a burning smell coming from the dryer itself during operation, even without visible damage to clothes. The thermal fuse has been replaced more than once — this means the triggering condition (almost always a vent restriction) was never corrected.</p>

                <p>Lint inside a dryer and exhaust duct is highly flammable. The U.S. Fire Administration reports that dryers cause approximately 2,900 residential fires per year, with failure to clean the dryer or vent as the leading contributing factor. An overheating dryer that continues to operate presents a fire risk that extends beyond the appliance itself.</p>

                <h2>When to Seek Professional Diagnosis</h2>
                <p>If the vent system is clear, the lint screen is clean, and the exterior vent flap opens freely, but the dryer still overheats or shuts off from heat — the problem is internal. Testing the cycling thermostat, high-limit thermostat, and heating element requires a multimeter and partial disassembly of the dryer cabinet. These are not safe DIY repairs for most homeowners.</p>

                <p>Professional diagnosis is appropriate when: the thermal fuse has blown more than once in a year; the dryer shuts off from heat despite a clean, clear vent system; clothes are consistently scorched or smell burned; a burning smell comes from inside the dryer itself; or the dryer has recently undergone a heating element or thermostat replacement but the problem has returned.</p>

                <h2>What a Technician Evaluates</h2>
                <p>A technician diagnosing an overheating dryer begins with airflow. Using a flow meter or anemometer, they measure exhaust velocity at the exterior vent and compare it against the manufacturer's specified range for that model. They disconnect the exhaust duct from the dryer to test airflow at the dryer's own exhaust collar — this isolates whether the restriction is in the duct or inside the machine itself. The vent run is examined for length, number of elbows, and any sections of flexible duct that may be restricting flow.</p>

                <p>Once airflow is assessed, the technician tests the cycling thermostat using a multimeter and heat source, verifying it opens and closes at the correct temperatures. The high-limit thermostat is tested for continuity. The heating element is tested for resistance within specification and for a ground fault (current leakage to the housing). Felt drum seals are inspected visually for wear, tearing, or gaps at the front and rear drum openings.</p>

                <p>Common repairs: exhaust duct cleaning or replacement; cycling thermostat replacement; high-limit thermostat replacement; thermal fuse replacement (paired with root cause correction); heating element replacement; drum felt seal replacement. Most of these repairs are completed in a single visit. Because overheating failures are often multi-component (a vent restriction causes thermostat failure, which blows the thermal fuse), a thorough diagnosis identifies all affected components rather than just the most obvious one.</p>

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                <p><strong>My dryer isn't scorching clothes but the cabinet feels very hot — is that a problem?</strong> It depends on degree. Dryers produce significant heat, and some warmth on the cabinet is normal. But if the top or sides are too hot to rest your hand on comfortably for more than a second or two, the internal temperature is above the expected range. The most common cause is a restricted vent. Check the exterior vent flap for airflow, clean the lint screen, and inspect the duct for kinks before assuming a component failure.</p>

                <p><strong>My thermal fuse blew — do I just replace it, or is there something else?</strong> Replace the fuse, but also find the cause. Thermal fuses blow because the dryer reached a temperature high enough to trigger them. That cause — almost always a clogged vent or failed cycling thermostat — is still present after the fuse is replaced. A dryer that blows fuses repeatedly will keep blowing them until the root cause is corrected.</p>

                <p><strong>Can I use my dryer while I wait to have it looked at?</strong> If the dryer is scorching clothes, smelling of burning, or shutting off from heat, no — continued use carries a fire risk. If it's simply running hotter than normal but not causing visible damage, keep loads small and never run the dryer unattended or overnight until the issue is diagnosed.</p>

                <p><strong>How often should I have my dryer vent cleaned?</strong> Most manufacturers and fire safety organizations recommend annual vent cleaning for average household use (5–7 loads per week). Households with more frequent laundry, longer vent runs, or pets (whose fur bypasses the lint screen more easily) benefit from cleaning every 6 months.</p>
