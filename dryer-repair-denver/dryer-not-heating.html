            <h1>Why Is My Dryer Running But Not Heating?</h1>
            <p class="hero-text">A dryer that tumbles normally but blows no heat has a specific failure in its heating system. This guide covers the most common causes for both electric and gas dryers, what you can safely check yourself, and what a technician examines during diagnosis.</p>

                <h2>Root Causes of a Dryer Not Heating</h2>
                <p><strong>Failed Heating Element (electric dryers):</strong> The heating element is a coiled wire inside a metal housing that generates heat when current flows through it. After years of repeated thermal cycling, the coil develops weak spots and eventually breaks, creating an open circuit. The dryer continues to tumble and the motor runs normally, but only unheated air moves through the drum. A visual inspection sometimes reveals a break in the coil; a continuity test confirms it definitively.</p>

                <p><strong>Blown Thermal Fuse:</strong> The thermal fuse is a one-time safety device mounted on the exhaust duct or blower housing. It permanently cuts power to the heating circuit if the dryer overheats beyond a threshold temperature. Once blown, it must be replaced — it cannot reset. Importantly, a blown thermal fuse is almost always a symptom of an underlying problem (blocked exhaust vent, failed cycling thermostat) rather than the root cause. If only the fuse is replaced without finding the cause, the replacement fuse will blow again.</p>

                <p><strong>Cycling Thermostat or High-Limit Thermostat Failure:</strong> The cycling thermostat regulates operating temperature by turning the heating element on and off throughout the cycle. The high-limit thermostat is a backup safety cutoff. Either one can fail in the open position, breaking the heating circuit. A failed cycling thermostat often causes intermittent heat loss — the dryer heats for a while, then stops, then may heat again.</p>

                <p><strong>Gas Igniter Failure (gas dryers):</strong> The igniter glows to ignite the gas burner. If the igniter is weak or broken, it may glow orange but never reach the temperature threshold required to open the gas valve. The result is a gas dryer that runs the motor, tumbles, and the igniter glows — but no flame ever lights, so no heat is produced.</p>

                <p><strong>Gas Valve Coils (gas dryers):</strong> Once the igniter reaches ignition temperature, solenoid coils on the gas valve open to release gas to the burner. Worn coils can fail intermittently, producing heat for part of a cycle before the valve stops opening. This causes clothing to be partially dried but still damp at the end of the cycle.</p>

                <h2>Visual Inspection Steps</h2>
                <p><strong>Check the exhaust vent:</strong> Go outside and find the dryer exhaust vent cap on the exterior wall. With the dryer running, check that air is blowing out forcefully. Weak or no airflow indicates a blockage in the ductwork — a frequent cause of thermal fuse failure. A blocked vent is something you can diagnose without opening the machine.</p>

                <p><strong>Check for intermittent vs. complete heat loss:</strong> Does the dryer produce no heat at all from the first minute, or does it start warm and lose heat partway through the cycle? Complete absence of heat from the start suggests a failed heating element, blown thermal fuse, or open thermostat. Intermittent heat loss that comes and goes suggests a cycling thermostat problem or, in gas dryers, failing gas valve coils.</p>

                <p><strong>On gas dryers — check the supply:</strong> Confirm the gas shutoff valve on the line behind the dryer is fully open (handle parallel to the pipe). If other gas appliances in the home are also not working, the issue is with the supply, not the dryer itself.</p>

                <h2>Safe DIY Checks</h2>
                <p><strong>Clean the lint trap before every load</strong> and clean the exhaust ductwork at least once a year. A partially blocked vent is the single most common cause of thermal fuse failure. Disconnect the duct from the back of the dryer and check inside for lint accumulation. Use a vent cleaning brush to clear buildup.</p>

                <p><strong>Do not attempt to test the heating element or thermal fuse with the dryer plugged in.</strong> These components are accessible only after opening the cabinet, which requires the dryer to be disconnected from power. Electric dryers use 240V — double the standard household voltage — which is potentially lethal on contact.</p>

                <h2>Safety Notes</h2>
                <p>Never operate a dryer with a known blocked exhaust duct. Restricted airflow forces the dryer to run hotter than designed, which can ignite accumulated lint inside the duct — a leading cause of house fires. For gas dryers, if you smell gas at any point, stop use immediately, leave the area, and contact your gas utility provider before calling for appliance service.</p>

                <h2>When to Call a Professional</h2>
                <p>If the exhaust vent is clear but the dryer still produces no heat, the cause is an internal component failure requiring a multimeter and partial disassembly to diagnose. This applies whether you have an electric or gas dryer. Gas dryer repairs involving the igniter or valve coils should always be done by a qualified technician due to the gas supply involved.</p>

                <h2>Professional Repair Process</h2>
                <p>A technician diagnosing a no-heat dryer begins by checking the thermal fuse for continuity — a blown fuse is confirmed quickly and points toward an overheat event. They then test the heating element (electric) or igniter (gas) for continuity and check the cycling and high-limit thermostats. For gas dryers, igniter current draw is measured to determine whether the igniter is strong enough to trigger the gas valve, and the valve coils are tested individually.</p>

                <p>If the thermal fuse is blown, the technician also inspects the entire exhaust path for restriction and measures airflow to identify what caused the overheat. Replacing the fuse without fixing the airflow restriction leads to repeated fuse failures. Common repairs: heating element replacement, thermal fuse replacement, cycling or high-limit thermostat replacement, igniter replacement, gas valve coil replacement. Most are completed in a single visit. See our guide on <a href="/dryer-repair-denver/dryer-making-noise.html">dryer noise causes</a> if the machine is also making unusual sounds — a failing motor or blower can sometimes affect both heat and noise.</p>

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                <p><strong>My dryer heats for a few minutes then stops — what causes that?</strong> Intermittent heat loss most often points to a failing cycling thermostat (which is cycling the element off but not back on) or, in gas dryers, weakening gas valve coils. A completely failed high-limit thermostat can also latch in the open position after the first overheat, stopping heat for the rest of the cycle. All three require a continuity test to confirm.</p>

                <p><strong>If the thermal fuse blew, why did that happen?</strong> The thermal fuse is a symptom indicator, not a root cause. It blows when the dryer overheats. The most common causes of overheating are: a blocked exhaust vent (lint buildup or crushed duct), a failed cycling thermostat that never cuts the element off, or a restricted lint trap that's overdue for cleaning. Replacing only the fuse without clearing the root cause will result in another blown fuse within a few cycles.</p>

                <p><strong>Does a no-heat dryer use electricity?</strong> Yes. A dryer that produces no heat still runs the motor (for tumbling) and any controls or sensors. It consumes less energy than normal because the heating element isn't drawing current, but it isn't energy-free. Running multiple full cycles with no heat in an attempt to dry laundry adds up in electricity cost with no benefit.</p>
