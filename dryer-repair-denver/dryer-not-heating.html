            <h1>Why Is My Dryer Running But Not Heating?</h1>
            <p class="hero-text">A dryer that tumbles normally but blows no heat has a specific failure in its heating system. This guide covers the most common causes for both electric and gas dryers, what you can safely check yourself, and what a technician examines during diagnosis.</p>

                <h2>Recognizing the Symptom Pattern</h2>
                <p>Not all heat failures present the same way. Identifying which pattern matches your dryer helps distinguish between the likely causes before any component testing begins.</p>

                <p><strong>No heat from the very first minute of the cycle:</strong> The drum tumbles normally, the timer or display functions, but air coming through the drum is room temperature or only slightly warm. Complete absence of heat from the start of a cycle points to a fully open circuit in the heating system: a blown thermal fuse, a failed heating element (electric), a burned-out igniter (gas), or a thermostat stuck permanently open.</p>

                <p><strong>Heat for a few minutes, then stops mid-cycle:</strong> The dryer begins warming normally but the heat cuts off partway through and doesn't return. This pattern — intermittent heat loss — is characteristic of a failing cycling thermostat that cycles the element off but can't turn it back on, or on gas dryers, weakening gas valve coils that open for a limited number of ignitions before failing to open further.</p>

                <p><strong>Drum tumbles but clothes are barely warmer than when they went in:</strong> Reduced heat rather than complete heat loss. This may indicate a partially failed heating element (some coil sections burned out, others still working), or a thermostat that opens prematurely at too low a temperature. Clothes come out damp and warm rather than dry and hot.</p>

                <p><strong>Igniter glows but no flame appears (gas dryers):</strong> If you can observe the igniter through the burner access opening, a glowing igniter that never produces a flame indicates the igniter is not reaching the temperature threshold required to trigger the gas valve solenoids, or the solenoids themselves have failed.</p>

                <h2>Most Common Causes of a Dryer Not Heating</h2>
                <p><strong>Failed Heating Element (electric dryers):</strong> The heating element is a coiled resistance wire enclosed in a metal housing. When current flows through the coil, it generates heat. Over years of repeated thermal expansion and contraction cycles, the coil wire develops weak points and eventually fractures, creating an open circuit. When the element fails completely, no heat is produced even though the motor, drum, and blower continue operating normally. The dryer runs and tumbles but the air moving through it is unheated.</p>

                <p>Some heating elements fail partially — a single break in one section of a multi-section element. In this case, the element produces some heat but at reduced output, extending drying times significantly rather than eliminating heat entirely. A complete failure is confirmed with a continuity test; a partial failure requires resistance measurement to identify sections with abnormally high or infinite resistance.</p>

                <p><strong>Blown Thermal Fuse:</strong> The thermal fuse is a one-time-use safety device positioned on the blower housing or exhaust duct. It permanently interrupts the heating circuit when the dryer reaches a temperature above its rated threshold — a failsafe against fire if the machine overheats. Once blown, the fuse cannot reset; it must be physically replaced.</p>

                <p>On many models, a blown thermal fuse cuts power to the heating circuit only, leaving the motor and drum functional. On others, it cuts power to the entire machine. Either way, the fuse itself is not the underlying problem — it is evidence that the dryer previously overheated. The root cause (almost always restricted exhaust airflow or a failed cycling thermostat) must be identified and corrected alongside fuse replacement, or the replacement fuse will blow again under the same conditions.</p>

                <p><strong>Failed Cycling Thermostat:</strong> The cycling thermostat reads air temperature inside the drum and toggles the heating element on and off to maintain the target operating temperature range. When this thermostat fails in the open position — meaning it permanently reads "too hot" and keeps the heating circuit open — the heating element cannot energize. The dryer runs and tumbles but produces no heat. A cycling thermostat failure is not detectable by visual inspection; it requires a continuity test with a multimeter to confirm.</p>

                <p>A thermostat that fails intermittently (working sometimes, opening permanently at others) produces the pattern of heat for a few minutes followed by permanent heat loss for the remainder of the cycle. This is one of the more confusing failure modes because the dryer may appear to start normally before the problem becomes obvious.</p>

                <p><strong>Failed High-Limit Thermostat:</strong> The high-limit thermostat is a separate safety component, positioned near the heating element housing, designed to cut the heating circuit if temperatures exceed a maximum safe threshold. When this thermostat fails open — permanently rather than at a trigger temperature — it creates the same effect as a failed cycling thermostat: the heating circuit stays broken and no heat is produced. High-limit thermostat failures are less common than cycling thermostat failures but are tested in sequence during diagnosis.</p>

                <p><strong>Gas Igniter Failure (gas dryers):</strong> Gas dryers heat air by igniting a gas burner. The igniter is a silicon carbide or silicon nitride element that heats to glow orange when current flows through it. When the igniter reaches the temperature required to trigger the gas valve solenoids, the valve opens, gas flows, and the burner ignites. If the igniter is cracked, weakened by age, or has developed too-high resistance, it may glow but never reach the threshold temperature needed to trigger the valve — the result is a dryer that runs, the igniter glows visibly, but no flame ever lights and no heat is produced.</p>

                <p><strong>Failed Gas Valve Solenoid Coils (gas dryers):</strong> Even when the igniter functions correctly, the gas valve requires solenoid coils to energize and physically open the valve ports. These coils fail over time from the heat cycles they experience. A common failure pattern for weakening coils is intermittent operation: the valve opens for the first ignition of a cycle but fails to reopen after the burner cycles off, leaving the dryer without heat for the remainder of the cycle. Clothes come out partially dried — warm from the initial heat period but still damp because heat was absent for most of the cycle.</p>

                <h2>Checks You Can Do Yourself</h2>
                <p><strong>Inspect the exhaust vent for restrictions:</strong> Go outside and find where the dryer exhausts on the exterior wall. With the dryer running, hold your hand in front of the vent — you should feel a strong, warm flow of air. Weak or no airflow indicates a restriction in the duct, which is the most common cause of thermal fuse failure. Also check that the vent cap flap opens freely and isn't stuck closed by a buildup of lint or by a damaged damper.</p>

                <p><strong>Inspect the exhaust duct behind the dryer:</strong> Pull the dryer away from the wall and examine the flexible or rigid duct connecting the dryer to the wall. Check for kinks, crushing, or disconnected sections. A crushed section drastically reduces airflow and causes the dryer to overheat, stressing the thermal fuse and thermostats. Reconnect any disconnected sections and replace any crushed flexible duct.</p>

                <p><strong>On gas dryers — verify the gas supply:</strong> Locate the gas shutoff valve on the supply line behind the dryer. The valve handle should be parallel to the pipe (open position). If it is perpendicular, it has been turned off. Check whether other gas appliances in the home (stove, water heater) are working — if they are not, the problem is with the house gas supply rather than the dryer. If they are working, the dryer's own supply valve and internal components need inspection.</p>

                <p><strong>Check for a tripped circuit breaker (electric dryers):</strong> Electric dryers use a 240-volt double-pole circuit. If one leg of this circuit has a tripped breaker, the motor may run normally (using only one 120-volt leg) while the heating element — which requires the full 240 volts — receives no power. The dryer runs and tumbles with no heat. Check the panel for a breaker in the middle (tripped) position, switch it fully off, then back on.</p>

                <p><strong>Do not attempt to access internal heating components with the dryer powered:</strong> The heating element, thermal fuse, and thermostats are accessible only after opening the dryer cabinet, which must be done with the machine unplugged or the circuit breaker switched off. Electric dryers operate at 240 volts — twice standard household voltage — which presents a serious shock risk if components are touched while energized.</p>

                <h2>Safety</h2>
                <p>Never run a dryer with a known blocked exhaust duct, even to test whether the heating issue is resolved. Restricted airflow causes internal temperatures to climb to levels that can ignite accumulated lint inside the duct or machine — dryer exhaust duct fires are a well-documented hazard.</p>

                <p>For gas dryers: if you smell natural gas near the dryer at any point, do not attempt to operate the machine or test components. Leave the area, avoid operating any electrical switches, and contact your gas utility provider's emergency line from outside the building. Gas appliance repairs should only proceed after confirming there is no active gas leak.</p>

                <h2>When to Seek Professional Diagnosis</h2>
                <p>If the exhaust vent is clear, the circuit breaker is intact (electric), and the gas supply is confirmed on (gas) — but the dryer still produces no heat — the problem is an internal component failure. Testing the thermal fuse, heating element, thermostats, igniter, and gas valve coils each requires a multimeter and in most cases partial disassembly of the dryer cabinet. Gas dryer repairs involving the igniter or valve coils carry additional risk from the gas supply and are best handled by a qualified technician.</p>

                <h2>What a Technician Evaluates</h2>
                <p>A technician diagnosing a no-heat dryer begins with the thermal fuse — it is the quickest test and a blown fuse immediately confirms an overheat event occurred. If the fuse is blown, the technician also evaluates the exhaust system for restriction and the cycling thermostat for failure, since the fuse failure is a downstream effect of one of these conditions. Replacing only the fuse without correcting the root cause leads to the new fuse failing under the same conditions.</p>

                <p>For electric dryers with an intact thermal fuse, the heating element is tested for continuity across the full coil and for any open sections. The cycling thermostat and high-limit thermostat are each tested for continuity — a thermostat that reads open at room temperature has failed and must be replaced. For gas dryers, the igniter is tested for continuity and its resistance is measured to determine whether it can draw sufficient current to trigger the valve solenoids. The gas valve solenoid coils are tested individually for the correct resistance values.</p>

                <p>Common repairs: thermal fuse replacement (paired with vent correction); heating element replacement; cycling thermostat replacement; high-limit thermostat replacement; gas igniter replacement; gas valve solenoid coil replacement or gas valve assembly replacement. Thermal fuse, thermostat, and igniter replacements are typically quick. Heating element replacement takes longer depending on model access but is completed in a single visit for most machines. If you've noticed the dryer also running louder than usual, see our related guide on <a href="/dryer-repair-denver/dryer-making-noise.html">why a dryer is making noise</a> — a failing blower wheel can affect both airflow and heating circuit reliability.</p>

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                <p><strong>My dryer heats for a few minutes then stops — what causes that?</strong> Intermittent heat loss — where the dryer starts warm but loses heat partway through and doesn't recover — most commonly points to a cycling thermostat that has failed in a way that prevents it from re-closing the heating circuit after it opens. In gas dryers, weakening gas valve solenoid coils produce exactly this pattern: they open for the first burner ignition of a cycle but fail to open again when the burner attempts to re-light. A thermostat stuck in the open position after an initial overheat event can also produce this symptom.</p>

                <p><strong>The thermal fuse blew — do I just replace it?</strong> Replace it, but also find the cause. The thermal fuse blows because the dryer previously overheated beyond its rated threshold. That condition — most often a restricted exhaust vent, a clogged lint screen, or a failed cycling thermostat that let the heating element run unchecked — is still present after the fuse is replaced. A dryer that has blown a thermal fuse once will blow another fuse quickly if the triggering condition is not corrected. Identifying and resolving the root cause is as important as the fuse replacement itself.</p>

                <p><strong>Does a dryer with no heat still use electricity?</strong> Yes. A no-heat dryer still runs the motor, blower, timer or control board, and any sensors. It draws significantly less total power than normal because the heating element — which is the largest electrical load in the machine — isn't energized. But running multiple extra cycles in an attempt to dry laundry without heat still accumulates energy cost with no useful result.</p>

                <p><strong>Is a no-heat dryer safe to continue using while waiting for repair?</strong> The dryer is not a fire hazard in its no-heat state, and tumbling damp laundry without heat isn't harmful to the machine. However, if the root cause is a restricted vent, running the machine puts additional stress on other thermostats and components. If the thermal fuse has already blown once, avoid continued use until the cause is identified — a dryer running with a restricted vent can sustain damage to other heat-related components.</p>
