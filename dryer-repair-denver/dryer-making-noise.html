            <p class="hero-text">Squealing, thumping, grinding, or rattling from a dryer usually points to worn mechanical components inside the cabinet. This guide explains the most common noise sources, how to narrow down which part is failing, and what a technician examines during diagnosis.</p>

                <h2>Identifying the Noise Pattern</h2>
                <p>The character and timing of the noise provides diagnostic information before any panel is opened. Paying close attention to these two qualities narrows the cause significantly.</p>

                <p><strong>Rhythmic thumping or rumbling that follows drum rotation speed:</strong> This pattern — where the sound repeats once or twice per drum revolution — is the hallmark of worn drum support rollers. The rubber on the roller has developed a flat spot or hardened unevenly, creating an irregular surface that produces impact noise with each rotation.</p>

                <p><strong>Steady high-pitched squeal that runs continuously throughout the cycle:</strong> A constant squeal at a fixed pitch, present regardless of how full the drum is, typically indicates a worn idler pulley bearing. The pulley is spinning continuously at a fixed rate while the belt runs over it, so a bearing fault inside produces a consistent tone unrelated to drum speed.</p>

                <p><strong>Scraping or grinding that's always present when the drum turns:</strong> Metal-to-metal contact, usually from worn drum glides at the front bulkhead. This sound typically worsens progressively over weeks as the glides wear further through.</p>

                <p><strong>Rattling, clicking, or fluttering — especially from below the drum:</strong> A foreign object (coin, button, clip, zipper pull) that has passed through the lint screen and reached the blower wheel. The sound often starts suddenly after drying clothing with items in pockets.</p>

                <p><strong>Thumping or squealing when the load is heavy, quiet when light:</strong> A glazed or partially worn drum belt that slips under load, or drum rollers just beginning to wear. The noise appears under resistance but not under light conditions.</p>

                <h2>Most Common Causes of Dryer Noise</h2>
                <p><strong>Worn Drum Support Rollers:</strong> Most dryers support the drum on two or more rubber-coated rollers mounted to the rear bulkhead, and sometimes additional rollers at the front. These rollers carry the full weight of the drum and its load through thousands of rotation cycles. Over time, the rubber compound hardens from heat exposure and develops flat spots from repeated loading. Once flat spots form, each revolution produces a thump as that portion of the roller contacts the drum shaft or drum rim. As wear progresses, the flat spot deepens and the noise intensifies. In severe cases, the roller shaft can seize entirely, causing a grinding or dragging sound as the roller no longer turns freely.</p>

                <p>Roller wear is one of the most common sources of dryer noise in machines more than five years old. Because all rollers experience similar heat and load conditions, they tend to wear at similar rates — a machine with one noisy roller usually has others approaching the same condition.</p>

                <p><strong>Drum Drive Belt Wear:</strong> The drive belt is a long, thin, ribbed belt stretched around the full circumference of the drum, routed through the idler pulley assembly, and attached to the motor pulley. New belts are supple and grip evenly. After years of heat exposure and stretching, the belt's outer surface glazes, the rubber compounds dry out, and small cracks develop across the belt width. A glazed belt may squeal under load as it slips slightly on the drum surface, particularly noticeable when starting a heavy load. A belt developing cracks along its edges produces a periodic slapping or flapping sound. The final stage is a complete snap — at which point the drum stops turning entirely.</p>

                <p><strong>Failing Idler Pulley:</strong> The idler pulley is a spring-loaded wheel that maintains constant tension on the drive belt as the drum rotates. The pulley itself rotates continuously while the dryer runs, and its internal bearing supports this continuous rotation. As the bearing ages, the balls or races develop wear pits, and lubrication breaks down from heat. The result is a steady squeaking or squealing that persists throughout the entire cycle at a fixed pitch. The idler pulley is the most common source of a continuous squeal in dryers over five years old. Because it operates under constant belt tension, a failing idler pulley bearing can eventually seize, causing the belt to fail prematurely.</p>

                <p><strong>Worn Drum Glides or Drum Slides:</strong> The front edge of the drum rests on a series of plastic or felt pads — called drum glides or drum slides — mounted to the front bulkhead. These pads create a smooth bearing surface for the drum's front edge to rotate against. As the plastic or felt wears through from friction, the drum's metal edge begins contacting the metal front bulkhead directly. The resulting noise is a scraping or grinding sound, present whenever the drum rotates, that typically worsens gradually over weeks. The sound is most often heard from the front of the machine.</p>

                <p><strong>Blower Wheel Obstruction or Damage:</strong> Items that pass through the lint screen — coins, buttons, paper clips, hairpins, small fasteners — can travel into the exhaust path and reach the blower wheel. A small object caught between a blower fin and the blower housing produces intermittent rattling, clicking, or clattering. A cracked or broken blower fin from a previous impact creates an imbalance that produces a steady whirring or vibration during the entire cycle. Either condition reduces airflow in addition to causing noise, potentially extending drying times.</p>

                <p><strong>Rear Drum Bearing Wear:</strong> Some dryer models support the rear of the drum on a ball bearing or sleeve bearing at the center of the rear bulkhead. When this bearing wears out, the drum develops lateral wobble and the bearing produces a grinding, rumbling, or squealing sound from the back of the machine. A worn rear bearing also causes the drum to run out of round, which can accelerate belt and roller wear. This failure is less common than roller or idler pulley wear but more significant — a seized rear bearing can lock the drum in place.</p>

                <h2>Checks You Can Do Yourself</h2>
                <p><strong>Always empty pockets before loading:</strong> Coins and metal objects are the leading cause of sudden blower wheel damage and rattling. This simple habit eliminates one of the most preventable failure modes. If rattling started immediately after drying a load with items in pockets, investigate the blower area before assuming a mechanical failure.</p>

                <p><strong>Run the dryer empty for one full cycle:</strong> If the noise disappears or significantly reduces with an empty drum, the cause may be load-related rather than mechanical — zippers striking the drum, an unbalanced heavy item bouncing, or buttons scraping the drum interior. If the noise persists with no laundry inside, the problem is mechanical: rollers, belt, idler pulley, drum glides, or blower.</p>

                <p><strong>Listen and locate:</strong> Stand close to the dryer while it runs and try to identify where the sound originates. Rear-of-machine noises point toward drum rollers, the rear bearing, or the motor. Front-of-machine noises suggest drum glides or the front drum support. Noises from below the drum toward the bottom of the cabinet indicate the idler pulley, motor, or blower wheel.</p>

                <p><strong>Check that the dryer sits level:</strong> A dryer that isn't level can vibrate unevenly and produce rhythmic thumping from the cabinet contacting the floor or nearby surfaces. This can mimic drum roller noise. Check with a spirit level and adjust the leveling feet if needed — the dryer should sit solidly without rocking in any direction.</p>

                <p><strong>Check for debris in the lint trap housing:</strong> With the dryer unplugged, shine a flashlight down into the lint trap opening. Look for any small objects below the screen. If debris is visible and accessible without disassembly, remove it. If the debris is deeper in the blower path, professional access is required to avoid forcing it further into the blower.</p>

                <h2>Safety — When to Stop Using the Dryer</h2>
                <p>Stop running the dryer if the noise is a heavy grinding or loud scraping, or if the drum feels difficult to turn by hand when the machine is off. Worn-through drum glides produce metal-to-metal contact that progressively scores the drum edge — continued use turns what would be an inexpensive glide replacement into a drum replacement. A drum roller that has seized can cause the drum to drop or shift inside the cabinet, potentially damaging the wiring harness or heating element housing.</p>

                <p>Do not attempt to lubricate drum rollers, the idler pulley, or any other internal dryer components with household oil or grease. Lubricants inside a dryer attract lint and create a fire hazard inside a heat-producing appliance. Components that require lubrication should be replaced rather than treated with external lubricants.</p>

                <p>Always unplug the dryer or switch off its dedicated circuit breaker before opening any panel or reaching into the drum area for inspection.</p>

                <h2>When to Seek Professional Diagnosis</h2>
                <p>If the noise has persisted across multiple loads and isn't coming from a debris obstruction; if the squeal or thump is progressively getting louder cycle by cycle; if the noise is accompanied by the drum turning more slowly or with more resistance than usual; or if you cannot identify the source after careful listening — professional diagnosis is the appropriate next step. Accessing drum rollers, the idler pulley, drum glides, and the rear bearing all require removing the front or rear panel of the dryer cabinet.</p>

                <h2>What a Technician Evaluates</h2>
                <p>A technician begins by running the dryer briefly with a small load to listen and characterize the sound — timing relative to drum rotation, location, pitch, and whether it changes with load weight. They then open the cabinet and inspect the drum rollers by hand for flat spots, uneven surfaces, or shaft play. Each roller is rotated manually to feel for rough spots or resistance. The idler pulley is tested by hand for smooth bearing rotation and for any wobble suggesting a worn race. The drum belt is examined for glazing, cracking, or fraying along its edges.</p>

                <p>Drum glides are inspected visually for wear-through at the contact surfaces. The blower wheel is examined for debris lodged between fins and for cracked or chipped fins. On models with a rear drum bearing, the drum is moved laterally to check for excessive play indicating bearing wear.</p>

                <p>When drum rollers are replaced, they are replaced as a complete set — replacing only the loudest one leaves the others at different wear stages, and the problem typically returns quickly. The idler pulley and drum belt are often replaced together since they operate in contact with each other and reach comparable wear at similar intervals. After repair, a full test cycle with a load confirms that the noise has resolved completely before the job is closed.</p>

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                <p><strong>Does the type of sound reliably identify which part is failing?</strong> Generally yes, though not with certainty. A rhythmic thump matching drum rotation speed strongly suggests drum rollers. A steady continuous squeal at a fixed pitch suggests the idler pulley bearing. A scraping or grinding present whenever the drum turns suggests drum glides or a worn roller shaft. Rattling from below the drum suggests blower debris or a cracked blower fin. These patterns narrow the diagnosis before disassembly, but a technician will confirm with a hands-on inspection since multiple worn components can produce overlapping sounds.</p>

                <p><strong>Is it safe to keep using a noisy dryer in the short term?</strong> It depends on the type of noise. A mild squeak that isn't worsening is lower urgency — short-term use while arranging service is generally acceptable. A grinding or heavy scraping should be addressed promptly: worn-through drum glides creating metal-to-metal contact, or a roller shaft that has seized, can cause secondary damage to the drum itself if use continues. A fraying belt will eventually snap mid-cycle, leaving laundry damp and requiring a service call regardless.</p>

                <p><strong>Why do drum rollers need to be replaced as a set?</strong> All rollers in a dryer experience the same heat, load, and rotation conditions throughout the machine's life. When one roller has worn enough to become noisy, the others have accumulated nearly the same wear. Replacing only the noisiest roller leaves the others close to the same failure point — the noise often returns within months. Replacing the full set restores balanced drum support and avoids a repeat service call.</p>

                <p><strong>How long do drum rollers and the idler pulley typically last?</strong> Under normal household use, drum rollers typically last 8–12 years before the rubber hardens enough to develop flat spots. The idler pulley bearing often reaches a similar interval. High-usage households running multiple loads per day may see earlier wear. Dryers in especially dry climates, where rubber compounds dry out faster, may also see earlier roller failure relative to total cycle count.</p>
