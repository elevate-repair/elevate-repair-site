            <h1>Why Is My Stove Burner Not Working?</h1>
            <p class="hero-text">A burner that won't ignite or produce heat has a specific failure somewhere in its ignition, fuel, or electrical circuit. This guide covers the most common causes for both gas and electric burners, what you can safely check at home, and what a technician evaluates during diagnosis.</p>

                <h2>Recognizing the Symptom Pattern</h2>
                <p>Gas and electric burners fail in different ways. Identifying which pattern your burner matches helps narrow the cause before any inspection begins.</p>

                <p><strong>Gas burner clicks continuously but never lights:</strong> The ignition system is working electrically, but the spark isn't successfully igniting the gas. The most common causes are a wet or debris-covered igniter electrode, a misaligned burner cap, or clogged burner ports that are preventing proper gas distribution at the ignition point.</p>

                <p><strong>Gas burner produces no clicking sound when the knob is turned:</strong> The ignition circuit isn't completing. This points to a failed igniter electrode, a broken or corroded wire from the igniter to the spark module, a failed spark module, or a failed ignition switch at the knob itself.</p>

                <p><strong>Gas burner lights but flame is yellow, weak, or uneven:</strong> The burner is receiving gas and lighting, but gas distribution is compromised. Partially clogged burner ports are the primary cause — some holes are open while others are blocked, creating an uneven flame pattern. A proper gas flame should be predominantly blue with minor yellow tips.</p>

                <p><strong>Electric coil burner doesn't heat at any setting:</strong> The coil element has an open circuit — a break in its internal resistance wire. The element produces no glow and no heat regardless of the heat setting selected.</p>

                <p><strong>Electric burner heats on some settings but not others:</strong> The surface element is likely functioning, but the infinite switch (the control that varies power to the element) has worn contacts at certain heat positions. The element receives power at some switch positions but not others.</p>

                <p><strong>Smooth-top cooktop has a dead zone or no heat in one burner area:</strong> The radiant element beneath the glass has failed — either fully or in one section. On some smooth-top models, the element can fail in one portion while another portion still functions, causing uneven heating within the same burner zone.</p>

                <h2>Most Common Causes of a Non-Working Burner</h2>
                <p><strong>Clogged Burner Ports (gas):</strong> The burner cap sits over the burner base and contains a ring of small holes through which gas flows and ignites. Food spills, boil-overs, grease, and carbonized residue accumulate in these ports over time. When ports are partially or fully blocked, the gas flow pattern is disrupted — some sections of the flame ring receive gas while others don't, producing an uneven or incomplete flame. In severe blockage, the burner may not ignite reliably even if the igniter is sparking correctly directly beside a clogged port. This is one of the most preventable burner failures and often resolves with cleaning before any part replacement is needed.</p>

                <p><strong>Failed or Contaminated Spark Igniter (gas):</strong> Each gas burner has a ceramic spark igniter mounted near the burner base. When you turn the knob to ignite, the igniter receives high voltage from the spark module and generates a rapid clicking spark across a small gap to ignite the gas. Food debris, grease, and moisture all coat the igniter electrode and surrounding ceramic over time, interfering with spark generation. A contaminated igniter may produce a weak spark that can't reliably ignite gas, or none at all. The ceramic housing itself can crack from thermal cycling, eliminating the spark path entirely. A corroded or broken wire between the igniter and spark module also prevents any spark.</p>

                <p><strong>Failed Ignition Switch (gas):</strong> The ignition switch is the mechanism inside the control knob assembly that signals the spark module to fire when you push down or turn the knob. When the switch contacts wear out or corrode, no signal reaches the spark module even though the module, spark wires, and igniters may all be functional. On some ranges, this switch controls all burner igniters simultaneously — a failed switch can cause all burners to lose ignition at once rather than just one.</p>

                <p><strong>Burned-Out Surface Element (electric coil):</strong> Electric coil burners use a resistance wire coiled inside a metal tube. When current flows through the wire, it heats by resistance. As elements age, the resistance wire develops internal weak spots and eventually fractures, creating an open circuit. The element produces no heat and no visible glow at any heat setting. Visual inspection sometimes reveals a dark spot, blister, or crack in the coil tube, but many open-circuit failures aren't visible from the outside and require a continuity test to confirm.</p>

                <p><strong>Failed Infinite Switch (electric):</strong> The infinite switch is the stepped or continuously variable control that regulates how much power reaches the surface element. Inside the switch are bimetal contacts that cycle power on and off at different duty cycles to simulate different heat levels. When these contacts burn or corrode at specific positions, the switch loses its ability to complete the circuit at those settings — the element may heat on high but not on medium, or heat intermittently. A switch that has failed completely prevents the element from receiving power at any setting.</p>

                <p><strong>Failed Radiant Element (smooth-top electric):</strong> Smooth-top cooktops have radiant heating elements positioned beneath the ceramic glass surface. These elements are not serviceable through the glass — they are accessed by removing the cooktop. A failed radiant element produces no heat in its cooking zone, though the surrounding glass may still appear similar in color to an adjacent working burner, making the failure less immediately obvious than a coil element that fails to glow.</p>

                <h2>Checks You Can Do Yourself</h2>
                <p><strong>Clean the burner cap and ports (gas):</strong> Remove the burner cap and burner base — these lift off on most gas ranges without tools. Wash the cap and base in warm soapy water and use a thin wire, straightened paper clip, or toothpick to clear each individual port hole. Do not use abrasive pads that could widen the ports. Rinse and dry completely before reinstalling. Reinstall the cap firmly and in correct alignment — a misaligned or poorly seated burner cap is a common cause of ignition failure and uneven flames even when the ports are clean.</p>

                <p><strong>Clean the igniter electrode (gas):</strong> With the burner cap removed, locate the ceramic igniter near the burner base. Using a dry toothbrush or cotton swab, gently clean the electrode tip and the surrounding ceramic. Do not use water directly on the igniter — moisture in the igniter can cause clicking even when the knob is off. If the igniter has been recently wet (boilover, cleaning), allow the range to dry for several hours with the power on before testing again.</p>

                <p><strong>Test adjacent burners (gas and electric):</strong> If one burner fails, test the others. If all burners have lost ignition simultaneously (gas) or if all burners are dead (electric), the problem is upstream — a power issue, a failed spark module (gas), or a tripped circuit breaker (electric). If only one burner is affected, the failure is local to that burner's components.</p>

                <p><strong>Check the circuit breaker (electric):</strong> Electric ranges use a double-pole 240-volt circuit breaker. A tripped breaker can cut power to all surface elements. Check the electrical panel for a breaker in the tripped (middle) position. Switch it fully off, then back on. If it trips again immediately, there is an electrical fault in the range that requires professional attention before the appliance is used again.</p>

                <p><strong>Try plugging in a coil element to another port (electric coil):</strong> On ranges with plug-in coil elements (prongs that push into a receptacle block), you can swap a known-working element from another burner into the non-working burner's receptacle. If the working element heats in the non-working burner's position, the original element has burned out. If it still doesn't heat, the receptacle block or infinite switch for that position is the problem.</p>

                <h2>Safety</h2>
                <p><strong>Gas ranges — smell of gas:</strong> If you smell gas near the range at any time — when attempting to ignite a burner, after a failed ignition attempt, or at any other time — do not attempt to light the burner, do not operate any electrical switches, and do not use open flame. Leave the area, ventilate if possible without operating fans (they are electrical), and contact your gas utility's emergency line from outside the building. A small amount of unburned gas during a failed ignition attempt is normal and dissipates quickly with ventilation, but a persistent gas smell indicates a leak that must be addressed before the range is used.</p>

                <p><strong>Electric ranges — working on elements:</strong> Never reach into the area behind or beneath a surface element while the range is connected to power. Disconnect the range from power — unplug or switch off the dedicated circuit breaker — before swapping coil elements or accessing any internal components. Coil element terminal blocks carry line voltage when powered.</p>

                <h2>When to Seek Professional Diagnosis</h2>
                <p>If cleaning the burner ports and igniter electrode hasn't resolved a gas ignition failure; if all burners have lost ignition simultaneously; if the flame pattern remains uneven or yellow after cleaning; if an electric burner doesn't respond after trying a known-good element in its port — the problem is an internal component that requires testing with a multimeter and potentially partial disassembly.</p>

                <p>Gas igniter, spark module, and ignition switch replacements all require disconnecting power and in some cases working near the gas supply line. Smooth-top radiant element replacement requires removing the cooktop surface. These are appropriate for professional diagnosis and repair.</p>

                <h2>What a Technician Evaluates</h2>
                <p>For gas burner issues, a technician begins by visually inspecting the burner cap alignment and port condition, then cleans any clogged ports before testing components. The igniter electrode is tested for proper spark output — sparks should be blue-white and jump cleanly across the gap. The spark module is tested for correct voltage output at each igniter terminal. If the igniter and module test correctly but the burner still doesn't light, gas flow at the burner orifice is verified and the ignition switch at the knob is tested for continuity.</p>

                <p>For electric burners, the surface element is tested for continuity (open circuit indicates burnout) and the infinite switch is tested for voltage output at each control position. For smooth-top cooktops, the radiant element resistance is measured and compared to specification; a resistance reading outside the specified range indicates element failure.</p>

                <p>Common repairs: burner port cleaning; spark igniter replacement; spark module replacement; ignition switch replacement; coil surface element replacement; infinite switch replacement; smooth-top radiant element replacement. Most of these are completed in a single visit. If you've also noticed the oven cavity not heating, see our related guide on <a href="/oven-repair-denver/oven-not-heating.html">why an oven stops heating</a> — some control board failures affect both surface burners and oven operation simultaneously.</p>

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                <p><strong>My gas burner clicks constantly even when I'm not using it — is that a burner problem?</strong> Continuous clicking when no knob is turned is almost always caused by moisture around the igniter or a contaminated igniter electrode, rather than a burner port issue. It commonly happens after boilovers or after cleaning the cooktop with excess water. Dry the area thoroughly — a low oven heat for 20–30 minutes can help evaporate moisture from igniter ceramic — and the clicking should stop. If it continues after drying, the igniter may need cleaning or the igniter module may have a fault.</p>

                <p><strong>One burner on my gas range lights fine but the flame is yellow and weak — should I be concerned?</strong> A predominantly yellow flame indicates incomplete combustion, which usually means the air-to-gas mixture at that burner is off. This most often results from partially clogged ports limiting gas flow to certain sections of the burner ring. Clean the burner cap and ports as described above. A persistent yellow flame after cleaning may indicate a partially blocked burner orifice or an issue with gas pressure at that burner, both of which require professional attention.</p>

                <p><strong>Can I replace a coil burner element myself?</strong> Yes — coil surface elements that use a prong-and-receptacle connection (plug-in style) are straightforward to replace. The element pulls straight out of the receptacle and a replacement plugs in the same way. Verify the replacement matches your range's specifications (wattage and prong configuration). If the element is wired directly rather than plug-in, replacement requires disconnecting power and working with wiring — more appropriate for someone with electrical comfort or a technician.</p>

                <p><strong>All my gas burners lost ignition at the same time — what does that mean?</strong> Simultaneous loss of ignition on all burners points to a shared component: the spark module (which powers all igniter electrodes from one unit), a failed ignition switch that signals the module, or a loss of electrical power to the range's ignition circuit. Check that the range is properly plugged in and that the circuit breaker hasn't tripped. If power is confirmed, the spark module or ignition switch is the likely cause and requires professional testing.</p>
