            <h1>Why Won't My Oven Turn Off?</h1>
            <p class="hero-text">An oven that continues heating after you turn it off has a failure in its control circuit — most commonly a stuck relay on the control board, a failed thermostat, or a shorted temperature sensor. This guide explains the underlying causes, what to check, and what a technician evaluates during diagnosis.</p>

                <h2>Quick Answer</h2>
                <p>The most likely cause of an oven that won't turn off is a welded or stuck relay on the electronic control board. Relays are electromechanical switches that complete the heating circuit on command. When a relay's contacts fuse together from an electrical arc or heat damage, they create a permanent connection — the element receives power regardless of what the control panel commands. On older ovens with mechanical controls, a failed thermostat stuck in the closed position produces the same result. Either way, the safest immediate action is to disconnect the oven from power at the wall plug or circuit breaker until the cause is identified.</p>

                <h2>Common Causes</h2>
                <p><strong>Welded Control Board Relay:</strong> Modern ovens use an electronic control board with relays to switch power to the bake and broil elements. Each relay contains a coil and a set of contacts — the coil energizes to pull the contacts closed, completing the circuit; when the coil de-energizes, the contacts spring open, cutting power. Under certain conditions — a power surge, a momentary overload, or years of normal switching — the contacts can undergo electrical arcing severe enough to weld them in the closed position. A welded relay cannot be commanded open by the control board. The element stays permanently connected to line power until the oven itself is unplugged or the breaker is tripped. Control board relay failure is the most common cause of an oven that won't shut off on electronic-control models.</p>

                <p><strong>Failed Oven Thermostat (mechanical control ovens):</strong> Ovens with mechanical rotary controls regulate temperature using a thermostat — a bimetal device that opens and closes a switch as the oven temperature rises and falls. The thermostat is calibrated so its contacts open when the set temperature is reached, interrupting power to the element, and close again when the temperature drops. When thermostat contacts corrode, warp, or mechanically bind in the closed position, the circuit to the heating element stays permanently complete. The oven climbs past the set temperature without the thermostat intervening. Older freestanding ranges and some wall ovens are more likely to use mechanical thermostat control than newer electronic-control models.</p>

                <p><strong>Shorted Temperature Sensor:</strong> The temperature sensor (thermistor) monitors the oven cavity temperature and reports it to the control board as a changing resistance value. At room temperature, a typical oven sensor reads approximately 1,000–1,100 ohms, rising with temperature. If the sensor wire shorts to the oven chassis or the sensor itself internally shorts, the resistance drops sharply — often to near zero. The control board interprets this extremely low reading as a very cold oven temperature and responds by commanding the element on at full power, trying to reach the set point. The element runs continuously because the shorted sensor never reports that the oven has reached temperature. Unlike a welded relay, a shorted sensor may allow the control panel to respond to commands, but the element continues running because the control logic never receives confirmation that the target temperature has been hit.</p>

                <p><strong>Stuck or Shorted Touchpad/Membrane Switch:</strong> On ovens with touchpad controls, the control panel contains a membrane switch layer beneath the keypad surface. Each button position has a conductive pad; pressing the button bridges a circuit that the control board reads as a command. If the membrane layer is damaged by heat, moisture, or grease infiltration — or if a physical object presses against a button area — the control board may continuously receive an "on" or "increase temperature" command. The oven responds by activating or maintaining heat even when the user has not pressed anything. On some models, this also prevents the "cancel" or "off" button from registering, making the oven appear unresponsive to shutdown commands.</p>

                <p><strong>Damaged Wiring Causing a Short:</strong> High-temperature wiring runs throughout the oven cavity and control area to connect the control board, temperature sensor, and heating elements. The insulation on this wiring is rated for elevated temperatures but degrades over years of thermal cycling. If wire insulation cracks and two conductors contact each other, or if a conductor contacts the oven chassis at a point in the circuit that keeps the element energized, the element may receive power independently of the control board's commands. Wiring shorts in the oven cavity are less common than relay and thermostat failures but produce the same symptom of continuous heating.</p>

                <h2>Checks You Can Do Yourself</h2>
                <p><strong>Disconnect power immediately if the oven is heating uncontrollably:</strong> If the oven is running and you cannot turn it off through the control panel, unplug it from the wall or switch off the dedicated circuit breaker at the electrical panel. This is the correct and safe response — it does not damage the oven and stops the hazard. Note whether the oven has a single-pole or double-pole breaker (electric ovens use a double-pole 240-volt breaker; gas ovens use a single-pole 120-volt breaker for the controls and ignition). Flip the breaker fully off before returning on to reset it.</p>

                <p><strong>Observe whether the display and element disagree:</strong> Turn the oven on, set it to a temperature, then press Cancel or turn the knob to Off. Watch both the display and the element (visible through the oven window or by opening the door briefly). If the display shows "Off" or goes dark but the element remains visibly glowing orange, the control board has received the off command but the relay has not opened. This pattern strongly indicates a welded relay. If the display appears to still be running a cook cycle despite you pressing Cancel, the control panel may have a touchpad or control board fault preventing the off command from registering.</p>

                <p><strong>Check for error codes:</strong> Many electronic-control ovens display an error code when they detect an out-of-range sensor reading or a control board fault. Note any code shown on the display and look it up in your owner's manual or search "[model number] error code [code]." A code indicating a sensor fault (commonly F3 or F4 on many brands) alongside continuous heating points to a shorted or failed temperature sensor. A code indicating a relay or board fault points to the control board.</p>

                <p><strong>Test whether the oven responds to temperature changes:</strong> On models where the oven is still responding to some commands, set the temperature to a high value and then a low value. If the element brightness changes when you adjust the setting, the control board relay is functioning to some degree. If the element burns at full intensity regardless of setting — even when set to the lowest possible temperature — the circuit to the element is permanently closed, consistent with a welded relay or thermostat failure.</p>

                <h2>What NOT to Do</h2>
                <p>Do not leave the oven running and unattended if it is not responding to off commands. An oven operating without temperature regulation can exceed its designed maximum temperature, stressing internal components and increasing the risk of a fire inside the oven cavity if any grease or food debris is present.</p>

                <p>Do not attempt to remove the control panel cover or access internal wiring while the oven is connected to power. Electric ovens operate on 240 volts — double standard household voltage — and present a serious shock hazard if live components are touched. Disconnect power at the breaker before any inspection of internal parts.</p>

                <p>Do not assume the oven will eventually stop on its own. A welded relay or stuck thermostat has no self-correcting mechanism — these components will not free themselves through normal heating and cooling cycles. The oven will continue heating until power is removed or the component fails in a different way.</p>

                <h2>When to Seek Professional Diagnosis</h2>
                <p>If disconnecting and reconnecting power does not restore normal control — or if the oven returns to uncontrolled heating after power is restored — the fault requires component-level testing that involves partial disassembly and electrical measurement. Testing a control board relay requires measuring voltage output at the relay terminals during and after a commanded shutdown; testing a thermostat requires measuring its continuity at both room temperature and operating temperature. A shorted temperature sensor requires measuring resistance at the sensor terminals and comparing against the specification curve for that model.</p>

                <p>Do not use the oven until the underlying cause is identified and the faulty component is replaced. An oven that cannot be reliably shut off through its controls should be kept disconnected from power between uses at minimum — and ideally not used at all until repaired.</p>

                <h2>What a Technician Evaluates</h2>
                <p>A technician begins by reconnecting power in a controlled setting and observing the oven's behavior — specifically whether the element activates without a command, and whether the control panel's off command produces any change in element state. This initial observation identifies whether the fault is at the relay (element on, control responds), the control panel (control appears unresponsive), or the sensor (control appears to run normally but temperature isn't regulating).</p>

                <p>To test the control board relay, the technician measures voltage at the element terminals during a commanded "off" state. Voltage present when it shouldn't be confirms the relay contacts are not opening. The relay cannot be repaired individually on most modern boards — the entire control board is replaced. To test a mechanical thermostat, the contacts are checked for continuity at room temperature; a thermostat that shows continuity (closed circuit) when cold has failed in the stuck-closed position. The temperature sensor is tested by measuring its resistance at room temperature and comparing it to the expected value (typically around 1,100 ohms at 70°F for common sensor types); a reading near zero indicates a short.</p>

                <p>After any component replacement, the technician runs the oven through a complete heat-and-cool cycle, verifying that the element shuts off when commanded and that the control panel commands all register correctly. Common repairs for this symptom: control board replacement (most frequent on electronic-control ovens); thermostat replacement (mechanical-control ovens); temperature sensor replacement; wiring harness inspection and repair.</p>

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                <p><strong>Is it safe to use the circuit breaker to stop an oven that won't turn off?</strong> Yes — switching off the dedicated circuit breaker is the appropriate and safe way to cut power to an oven that won't respond to its controls. This is the intended function of the breaker and does not damage the oven. After the situation is resolved and the oven is repaired, the breaker can be switched back on without issue. Repeatedly tripping and resetting a breaker as a substitute for a functioning oven control is not a long-term solution, but as an emergency measure it is correct.</p>

                <p><strong>Why does my oven element glow even after I turn the knob to Off?</strong> On an electric oven, an element that stays visibly glowing after the knob is turned off indicates that the circuit to the element remains energized — the electrical connection has not been broken. On mechanical-control ovens, the thermostat or selector switch has a fault that is keeping the contacts closed. On electronic-control ovens, the most likely cause is a welded relay on the control board. In either case, the element is receiving continuous line-voltage power and will not stop heating until power to the oven is disconnected.</p>

                <p><strong>Can a stuck relay cause a fire?</strong> A welded relay is a serious fault that creates a risk of overheating inside the oven cavity. The oven's temperature regulation depends on the relay opening when the thermostat or temperature sensor signals that the set temperature has been reached. Without that ability, the oven climbs above its set temperature. Most ovens have a thermal limiter (a separate fuse-like safety device) that trips if the oven reaches an unsafe temperature — this provides one layer of protection. However, if significant grease accumulation is present inside the oven, the risk of ignition increases as temperatures climb above normal operating range. The oven should be kept unpowered until the relay is replaced.</p>

                <p><strong>My oven display says "Off" but the oven cavity is still hot — is something wrong?</strong> Residual heat after shutoff is normal — an oven cavity retains heat for 30–60 minutes after the element stops. If the display shows "Off" and the element is no longer glowing but the oven feels hot, this is likely just stored heat dissipating and is not a fault. If the element is still visibly glowing orange after the display shows "Off," or if the oven remains hot longer than 90 minutes after shutdown with the element clearly still active, there is a control fault.</p>

                <p><strong>My gas oven burner stays lit after I turn the knob to Off — is that the same problem?</strong> On a gas oven, a burner that stays lit after the knob is turned off is a different and more urgent situation than an electric element that stays on. A gas oven burner that won't extinguish means the gas safety valve is not closing when it should — gas is continuing to flow and combust. This is a gas supply and valve fault, not an ignition control fault. Turn the oven knob fully to Off, leave the area to ventilate, and contact your gas utility's emergency line if the burner does not extinguish promptly. Do not assume the valve will close on its own.</p>
