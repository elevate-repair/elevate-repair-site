            <h1>Why Is My Oven Not Heating?</h1>
            <p class="hero-text">An oven that stays cold, heats partially, or won't reach temperature has a specific failure in its heating circuit. This guide covers the most common causes for both electric and gas ovens, what you can check yourself, and what a technician evaluates during a professional diagnosis.</p>
        </div>

                <h2>Recognizing the Symptom Pattern</h2>
                <p>How the oven fails to heat — and when — provides diagnostic information before any component is tested.</p>

                <p><strong>Oven is completely cold — display works, preheat indicator runs, but no heat produced:</strong> The control board is receiving power and the control circuit is functioning, but the heating circuit has been interrupted. A failed bake element (electric), a failed igniter or gas safety valve (gas), or a failed control board relay are the primary causes.</p>

                <p><strong>Oven heats partially but won't reach temperature:</strong> Some heat is being produced but not enough to hit the set temperature. For electric ovens, this often indicates the bake element is partially working or the broil element is contributing less than expected. For gas ovens, a weakening igniter may light the burner intermittently rather than reliably, producing inconsistent heat. A temperature sensor sending a skewed reading can also cause the control board to shut off heat early, before the target temperature is actually reached.</p>

                <p><strong>Gas oven igniter glows for a long time but burner doesn't light:</strong> The igniter is receiving power and heating up, but it is not reaching the temperature threshold required to signal the gas safety valve to open. This is the classic symptom of a weakening igniter — it can glow visibly but lacks the amperage draw to trigger the valve. The igniter glowing for 60–90 seconds without a burner flame confirms this diagnosis in most cases.</p>

                <p><strong>Oven reaches temperature but food takes much longer than expected to cook:</strong> The oven is reaching the set temperature, but the temperature sensor may be reading inaccurately, causing the actual cavity temperature to differ from what the display shows. This is more a calibration or sensor issue than a heating failure, though both require the same diagnostic approach.</p>

                <p><strong>Error codes on the display (F1, F3, F4, or similar):</strong> Control boards on modern ovens generate error codes when they detect component failures. These codes often correspond directly to the failed component — F3 or F4 on many models indicates a temperature sensor failure, while other codes may point to control board or relay faults. Note any code and check your model's manual or search "[model number] error code [code]" for component identification.</p>

                <h2>Most Common Causes of an Oven Not Heating</h2>
                <p><strong>Failed Bake Element (electric):</strong> The bake element is the primary heating element for oven cooking, mounted to the bottom of the oven cavity. It is a tubular coil of resistance wire that glows red-orange when operating normally. When current flows through a break in the element's internal wire — caused by years of thermal stress — the circuit opens and the element produces no heat. The break may be visible on the element exterior as a crack, blister, or a spot where the element surface has burned through. However, many open-circuit element failures aren't visible from the outside and require a continuity test to confirm.</p>

                <p>A failed bake element results in no bottom heat. The oven control and display may function normally, and the broil element (if intact) may still work, but baking and roasting without bottom heat produces significantly undercooked results. The broil element alone does not substitute for the bake element in most cooking tasks.</p>

                <p><strong>Failed Broil Element (electric):</strong> The broil element is mounted to the top of the oven cavity and provides direct top-down radiant heat for broiling. A failed broil element produces no overhead heat during broil settings. Depending on the oven model, the broil element may also contribute to bake preheat cycles — a failed broil element can cause longer preheat times even on bake mode, in addition to eliminating broiling capability entirely.</p>

                <p><strong>Weakened or Failed Igniter (gas):</strong> Gas ovens use a hot surface igniter positioned at the burner. When energized, the igniter heats to a temperature that simultaneously signals the gas safety valve to open and provides an ignition source for the gas that flows out. As igniters age, their electrical resistance increases, reducing the current they can draw. When current draw falls below the threshold required to open the gas safety valve, the burner doesn't light — the igniter may still glow visibly, but the valve won't open without sufficient current flow through the igniter circuit. This is the most common cause of a gas oven that won't heat.</p>

                <p><strong>Failed Gas Safety Valve (gas):</strong> The gas safety valve is a solenoid-controlled valve that opens when the igniter reaches operating temperature. If the valve itself fails — the solenoid winds out, the valve body corrodes — it won't open even when the igniter is providing the correct signal. Gas oven safety valve failure is less common than igniter failure, but it is a distinct cause that requires testing the igniter first to rule it out before condemning the valve.</p>

                <p><strong>Failed Temperature Sensor (thermistor):</strong> The temperature sensor is a probe mounted inside the oven cavity that measures the actual air temperature and reports it to the control board as a resistance value. As the oven heats, the sensor's resistance changes in a predictable curve, and the control board uses this reading to determine when to cycle the heating element on and off. A sensor that has drifted out of calibration — or has failed entirely — sends an inaccurate reading. If the sensor reads "too hot" before the element has actually heated the cavity, the control board shuts off the element early, preventing the oven from reaching temperature. If it reads incorrectly in either direction, cooking results will be inconsistent even when the oven appears to be operating.</p>

                <p><strong>Control Board Relay Failure:</strong> The control board contains relays — electrically controlled switches — that complete the circuit to the bake or broil element (electric) or the igniter (gas). If a relay fails in the open position, it permanently breaks the circuit to the component it controls, and no heat is produced regardless of what other components are doing. Control board relay failures sometimes follow power surges. They may be accompanied by visible burn marks on the board at the failed relay, or they may show no visible damage and require electrical testing to confirm.</p>

                <h2>Checks You Can Do Yourself</h2>
                <p><strong>Visually inspect the bake and broil elements (electric):</strong> With the oven cool and unpowered, look at both the bottom element (bake) and the top element (broil). Look along the full length of each element for any visible cracks, blistered spots, small holes, or sections where the element surface appears burned through or collapsed. A visible defect confirms element failure. Note that no visible defect does not rule out a failed element — internal wire breaks often aren't visible from outside the element housing.</p>

                <p><strong>Check the circuit breaker (electric):</strong> Electric ovens operate on a 240-volt double-pole circuit. A tripped breaker can cut power to the elements while leaving the control board partially powered (since the board often runs on one 120-volt leg). If the display works but the oven produces no heat, check the electrical panel for a breaker in the tripped (middle) position. Switch it fully off, then back on. If it trips again immediately, there is an active electrical fault in the range.</p>

                <p><strong>Verify the gas supply (gas):</strong> Check that the gas shutoff valve on the supply line behind the range is fully open (handle parallel to the pipe). If other gas appliances in the home (stove burners, water heater) are also not working, the issue is with the house gas supply rather than the oven specifically. If the stovetop burners light normally, the gas supply is reaching the range and the oven issue is internal.</p>

                <p><strong>Watch the igniter during a heat cycle (gas):</strong> Turn the oven to bake at any temperature and observe the igniter through the oven bottom (remove the oven rack for a clearer view). The igniter should begin glowing orange and within 30–90 seconds, the burner should light with a low blue flame around the burner. If the igniter glows for more than 90 seconds without the burner lighting, the igniter is weakening and likely needs replacement. If the igniter doesn't glow at all, the igniter or its circuit has a fault.</p>

                <p><strong>Check for error codes:</strong> Note any codes displayed on the control panel and look them up in your owner's manual or online using your exact model number. Many error codes directly identify the failing component, which significantly simplifies diagnosis.</p>

                <h2>Safety</h2>
                <p><strong>Gas oven — smell of gas:</strong> If you smell gas when attempting to use the oven, or at any time near the appliance, do not operate the oven, do not operate any electrical switches, and do not attempt to light the oven manually. Leave the area, ventilate without using fans, and contact your gas utility's emergency line from outside the building. A brief faint smell during ignition that clears immediately is normal — a persistent gas odor is not.</p>

                <p><strong>Electric oven — element with visible damage:</strong> Do not operate an electric oven with a bake or broil element that has a visible crack, blister, or burn-through hole. A damaged element can arc against the oven cavity, blow a circuit breaker, or in rare cases create a fire risk inside the oven. Leave the oven unpowered until the element is replaced.</p>

                <p><strong>Working near internal oven components:</strong> Always unplug the oven or switch off its dedicated circuit breaker before inspecting or testing internal components. Electric oven elements and wiring carry 240-volt power — double standard household voltage — presenting a serious shock hazard if touched while energized.</p>

                <h2>When to Seek Professional Diagnosis</h2>
                <p>If the circuit breaker is intact, the gas supply is on, and no visible element damage is present — but the oven still doesn't heat — the problem requires component-level testing. Testing element continuity, sensor resistance, igniter amperage, and control board relay output all require a multimeter and in most cases partial disassembly of the oven.</p>

                <p>Gas oven igniter and safety valve replacements should be performed by someone with appropriate experience given the gas supply involved. Element replacement on electric ovens is more accessible, but should still be done with power disconnected and confirmed off.</p>

                <h2>What a Technician Evaluates</h2>
                <p>For electric ovens, a technician begins by testing both the bake and broil elements for continuity. An open circuit in either confirms element failure. The temperature sensor resistance is measured and compared to the specification curve for the oven's temperature range — a reading outside the expected range at room temperature confirms sensor failure. The control board is inspected for visible relay damage and tested for proper voltage output to the element circuit during a commanded heat cycle.</p>

                <p>For gas ovens, the igniter current draw is measured with a clamp meter or in-series ammeter during operation. The amperage is compared to the threshold required for the specific safety valve model — an igniter drawing less than the required current (typically 3.2–3.6 amps for most residential igniters) needs replacement. If the igniter draws sufficient current but the valve still doesn't open, the valve itself is tested for proper solenoid response and replaced if it has failed mechanically.</p>

                <p>Common repairs: bake element replacement; broil element replacement; temperature sensor replacement; gas igniter replacement; gas safety valve replacement; control board replacement. Element and igniter replacements are among the more common oven repairs and are typically completed in a single visit. Control board replacement is more involved but also generally completed in one visit for most models. See our related guide on <a href="/oven-repair-denver/oven-temperature-inaccurate.html">oven temperature inaccuracy</a> if your oven heats but the temperature is consistently off — this is a distinct issue from not heating at all, most often caused by a miscalibrated sensor or thermostat.</p>

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                <p><strong>My oven display shows the set temperature but the food isn't cooking — is the oven actually heating?</strong> The display shows the temperature the control board is targeting, not necessarily the actual cavity temperature. Place an oven thermometer inside and set the oven to a known temperature (350°F, for example). Check the thermometer after 20 minutes — if the reading differs significantly from the set temperature, the oven isn't reaching the target. This could indicate a failed or drifting temperature sensor, a partially failed element, or early-stage igniter weakness on a gas oven.</p>

                <p><strong>My gas oven igniter glows but the burner won't light — can I manually light it?</strong> Do not attempt to manually light a gas oven burner with a match or lighter. Gas ovens are not designed for manual ignition — the safety valve only opens when the igniter reaches operating temperature, and the burner orifice placement assumes ignition at that specific point. Attempting to introduce a flame manually while gas is or isn't flowing creates an unpredictable risk. If the igniter isn't triggering the burner, it needs to be replaced or the valve needs testing.</p>

                <p><strong>My electric oven element is cracked — can I still use the oven carefully?</strong> No. A cracked or visibly damaged element should be treated as an inoperable oven until replaced. A cracked element can arc against the oven cavity at the crack point when energized, producing a flash, tripping the breaker, or in rare circumstances igniting grease or food debris nearby. The risk isn't worth managing around — elements are among the more straightforward oven repairs.</p>

                <p><strong>My oven worked fine for years and then suddenly stopped heating — is that normal?</strong> Sudden no-heat failures are common with heating elements, gas igniters, and control board relays. These components operate for years without issue and then fail relatively abruptly — an element wire reaches a weak point and breaks, an igniter's resistance increases past the critical threshold, or a relay contact burns. Unlike gradual performance issues (which tend to build over time), a sudden complete heat failure typically indicates a single component has crossed its failure threshold.</p>
