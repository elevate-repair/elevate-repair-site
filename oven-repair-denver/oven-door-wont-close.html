            <h1>Why Won't My Oven Door Close Properly?</h1>
            <p class="hero-text">An oven door that won't seal flush loses heat, cooks unevenly, and poses a burn hazard from escaping hot air. This guide explains the mechanical reasons an oven door fails to close, what you can inspect yourself, and what a technician evaluates during diagnosis.</p>

                <h2>Recognizing the Symptom</h2>
                <p>Oven door closure problems present in several distinct ways. Which pattern you're seeing helps identify the cause.</p>

                <p><strong>Door closes but a visible gap remains along the top or sides:</strong> One or both hinges are damaged or have lost spring tension. The door can move to the closed position but doesn't seat flush against the oven opening on one side, leaving a gap where heat escapes.</p>

                <p><strong>Door hangs at an angle or one side is higher than the other:</strong> One hinge has failed while the other remains functional. The asymmetric support causes the door to tilt so that it cannot close evenly against the door frame.</p>

                <p><strong>Door doesn't stay in the partially-open broil position:</strong> The hinges include a detent (a hold-open position at roughly 15–20 degrees) for broiling with the door ajar. Loss of this position indicates the hinge springs have weakened or the hinge mechanism has worn past the detent notch.</p>

                <p><strong>Door closes physically but heat escapes around the edges:</strong> The door reaches the closed position and appears sealed, but hot air escapes from the perimeter during operation. This indicates a worn, hardened, torn, or displaced door gasket rather than a hinge problem.</p>

                <p><strong>Door won't open or close after a self-clean cycle:</strong> The self-clean latch has engaged or jammed. Ovens lock the door during self-clean; if the latch motor or mechanism fails partway through its cycle, the door can become stuck in the locked or partially-locked position.</p>

                <h2>Most Common Causes of an Oven Door That Won't Close</h2>
                <p><strong>Broken or Worn Door Hinges:</strong> Most oven doors are supported by a pair of spring-loaded hinges mounted to the oven frame. These hinges serve two functions: they carry the full weight of the door through thousands of open-and-close cycles, and their internal springs provide the tension that pulls the door firmly closed against the oven opening. Over years of high-temperature exposure and mechanical stress, hinge components fail in several ways. The hinge arm can crack at the pivot point. The internal spring can snap, eliminating the closing tension entirely. The hinge pin can wear through its bushing, creating looseness that allows the door to sag. When one hinge fails while the other remains intact, the door hangs unevenly — one side of the door may contact the frame while the other remains open.</p>

                <p>Hinge failure is gradual on most ovens. An early sign is the door requiring more force to close than it used to, or the door not staying in its partially-open broil position. Complete failure — where the door hangs open and won't seal — usually follows a period of worsening looseness.</p>

                <p><strong>Broken Hinge Springs:</strong> On some oven designs, the door spring is a separate component from the hinge itself — a torsion spring or extension spring mounted in a channel below the door or inside the oven cavity near the hinge pocket. These springs maintain door tension independently of the hinge mechanism. When a door spring breaks, the hinge may still rotate normally but has no tension to draw the door closed. The door becomes heavy and droopy, often swinging freely rather than holding at the closed position. A broken spring sometimes produces a noticeable sound when it fails — a snap or metallic clang — though not always.</p>

                <p><strong>Worn or Damaged Door Gasket:</strong> The oven door gasket is a woven fiberglass, silicone, or rubber seal that runs around the perimeter of the door or the oven cavity opening. It compresses slightly when the door closes, creating an airtight seal that keeps heat inside the oven cavity. Over years of repeated heating and cooling cycles, the gasket material hardens, compresses permanently and loses its ability to spring back, tears at corners or along the length, or pulls free from its mounting channel. A gasket failure doesn't prevent the door from physically closing — the door reaches its closed position normally — but it allows a significant amount of heat to escape around the perimeter, extending preheat times, causing uneven cooking temperatures, and increasing energy consumption.</p>

                <p><strong>Stuck or Jammed Self-Clean Door Latch:</strong> Ovens with self-clean cycles use an automatic latch mechanism that locks the door before the clean cycle begins and unlocks it after the oven cools. This latch is typically motor-driven. If the latch motor fails, the switch that signals the motor fails, or the mechanism jams (often from food debris in the latch slot), the latch can become stuck in the locked position — preventing the door from opening — or stuck in a partially-engaged position that blocks normal door closure. This is most likely to surface immediately after a self-clean cycle or during one.</p>

                <p><strong>Bent Hinge Receiver Slots:</strong> The hinge receiver is the slot in the oven frame into which the hinge arm slides when the door is installed. If this slot is bent or deformed — from the door being forced, a heavy object falling on the door, or the door being dropped while removed — the hinge arm cannot seat correctly in the receiver. The door may appear to be installed properly but won't close flush because the hinge geometry is off. This failure can also prevent the door from being removed or reinstalled correctly.</p>

                <h2>Checks You Can Do Yourself</h2>
                <p><strong>Inspect the hinges with the door open:</strong> Fully open the oven door and look at both hinges where they attach to the oven frame. With the door in the fully open position, the hinge arms should be visible. Look for visible cracks, bends, or a spring that appears broken or displaced. If one hinge looks significantly different from the other — bent, cracked, or missing a spring — that hinge has failed.</p>

                <p><strong>Check the gasket around the door perimeter:</strong> With the oven cool, run your hand around the gasket that seals the door. It should feel soft and pliable, with consistent thickness around its entire length. Squeeze sections of the gasket between your fingers — it should compress and spring back. Sections that feel hard, brittle, or flat have lost their sealing ability. Look for visible tears, gaps, or sections where the gasket has pulled out of its mounting channel. If the gasket has detached in sections, you may be able to reseat it in the channel temporarily.</p>

                <p><strong>Check whether the self-clean cycle is active or recently completed:</strong> If the door won't open after a self-clean cycle, the latch may simply need more time to cool. The door remains locked until the oven temperature drops below a safe threshold — typically below 550°F, which can take 30–60 minutes or more after the cycle ends. If the door remains stuck after 90 minutes of cooling, the latch mechanism has a fault.</p>

                <p><strong>Test door movement with light upward pressure:</strong> With the oven cold, hold the door handle and apply gentle upward pressure while closing the door. If the door closes flush with upward support but springs open or gaps when you release, the hinge springs have lost tension and are no longer pulling the door into the sealed position. This confirms a hinge spring or hinge problem rather than a gasket issue.</p>

                <h2>Safety</h2>
                <p>Do not operate the oven with a door that won't close properly. Heat escaping from a poorly sealed door creates a burn hazard at the front of the appliance — the exterior oven surface, door frame, and surrounding cabinetry will reach higher temperatures than expected. Children and pets near the oven are at particular risk from a door that allows hot air to escape at body level.</p>

                <p>Do not attempt to force a stuck self-clean latch open by pulling on the door handle with force. The latch mechanism is designed to withstand the force of someone pulling on the door during the cycle, and forcing it can bend the latch assembly or damage the door frame. Allow the oven to fully cool before investigating a stuck latch further.</p>

                <p>Hinge springs are under significant tension. Do not attempt to replace hinge springs without proper guidance for your specific model — a spring under tension can release with enough force to cause injury if it slips during installation. Door hinge replacement on most oven models requires removing the door first, which typically requires two people to manage safely.</p>

                <h2>When to Seek Professional Diagnosis</h2>
                <p>If the door visibly hangs at an angle, has a gap that persists after checking the gasket, or requires force to close — a hinge or spring failure is the likely cause and requires door removal for inspection. If the self-clean latch is stuck after the oven has cooled fully, the latch motor or mechanism has failed and the door may not be openable without professional intervention. Gasket replacement on most models is a manageable DIY task if the gasket is the confirmed cause.</p>

                <h2>What a Technician Evaluates</h2>
                <p>A technician begins by observing the door in the closed and partially-open positions to identify whether the problem is asymmetric (one-sided gap or angle) or uniform (gap along the full perimeter). An asymmetric problem indicates one failing hinge; a uniform gap more often points to a gasket or both hinges simultaneously weakening.</p>

                <p>The door is removed (most oven doors lift off the hinges when opened to a specific angle and the hinge locks are engaged) to access the hinges directly. Each hinge is inspected for cracks in the hinge arm, broken or weakened springs, and worn pivot points. On models with separate door springs, the spring channel is checked for broken or displaced springs. The hinge receiver slots in the oven frame are checked for bending or deformation. If the self-clean latch is stuck, the latch motor is tested for continuity and mechanical binding in the latch assembly is checked and cleared.</p>

                <p>The gasket is inspected around its full perimeter for hardening, tearing, and detachment from the mounting channel. Gasket replacement involves removing the old gasket, cleaning the channel, and pressing or clipping the new gasket into position. Common repairs: hinge replacement (typically in matched pairs); door spring replacement; door gasket replacement; self-clean latch motor replacement. Most are completed in a single visit.</p>

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                <p><strong>My oven door has a gap at the top but closes at the bottom — is that a hinge problem?</strong> Yes. A gap at the top with contact at the bottom indicates the door is tilting — typically because one hinge has lost spring tension or has failed while the other remains functional. The working hinge holds its side of the door in contact with the frame while the failed hinge allows the opposite side to pull away. Both hinges are usually replaced as a pair when this occurs.</p>

                <p><strong>My oven is losing heat but the door appears to close fully — could it still be the gasket?</strong> Yes. A gasket that has hardened or lost its compression may allow the door to close flush while still losing heat around the perimeter. The gasket needs to compress and spring back to maintain an airtight seal — a hardened gasket that doesn't compress effectively allows heat to escape even when the door appears properly closed. Testing the gasket by feel (pliable vs. hard/brittle) and checking for visible gaps or detachment confirms whether it is functioning.</p>

                <p><strong>The oven door is stuck shut after self-cleaning — is this an emergency?</strong> Not typically. The oven door locks automatically during the self-clean cycle for safety and remains locked until the interior temperature drops below a set threshold. If the door is still locked, the oven may simply not have cooled enough yet — allow additional time. If the oven has been fully cool for more than 90 minutes and the door remains locked, the latch motor or mechanism has likely failed in the locked position and requires professional attention to open safely.</p>

                <p><strong>Can I use my oven while waiting for hinge repair if the door closes most of the way?</strong> Using the oven with a door that doesn't seal completely results in significant heat loss, uneven cooking, and higher energy consumption. More importantly, hot air escaping from the door gap creates a burn risk for anyone standing near the oven. For short cooking tasks at lower temperatures, the risk may be acceptable, but for high-temperature baking or roasting, the oven will struggle to reach and hold the target temperature accurately.</p>
