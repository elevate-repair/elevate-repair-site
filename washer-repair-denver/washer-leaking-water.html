            <h2>Why Your Washer Is Leaking Water</h2>
            <p>On front-load washers, the most common source of leaks is a torn or deteriorated door boot seal. The boot seal is the large rubber gasket that creates a watertight connection between the door opening and the outer tub. Over time, this seal collects debris, develops mold, and can crack or tear from friction with clothing hardware like zippers and buttons. Even a small tear in the boot seal allows water to escape during the wash and rinse cycles, creating puddles in front of the machine.</p>
            <p>Internal hose failures are another frequent cause of washer leaks. The tub-to-pump hose carries water from the bottom of the wash tub to the drain pump, and it operates under pressure during every cycle. This hose can develop cracks at its connection points or along its length due to age, vibration, and exposure to detergent chemicals. Similarly, the hoses connecting the water inlet valve to the tub can crack or develop loose clamp connections. These internal leaks can be difficult to spot because the water appears underneath or behind the machine rather than in front.</p>
            <p>A worn tub seal and bearing assembly can also produce leaks, particularly on front-load washers. The tub seal sits between the outer tub and the spin shaft, preventing water from reaching the bearings. When this seal wears out, water seeps past it and drips from the bottom of the tub. You may also notice rust-colored water, which indicates the bearings are corroding. Detergent overflow is a less serious but surprisingly common cause &mdash; using too much detergent or the wrong type (non-HE detergent in an HE washer) creates excessive suds that can overflow through the door seal or dispenser housing and onto the floor.</p>

            <h2>Signs Your Washer Has a Leak</h2>
            <p>The most obvious sign is finding puddles of water under or around your washing machine after running a cycle. Pay attention to when the leak occurs: water appearing during the fill phase often points to an inlet valve or supply hose problem, while water during the wash or spin cycle suggests a tub seal, boot seal, or internal hose issue. Leaks that only occur during the drain cycle typically indicate a drain hose or pump connection failure.</p>
            <p>Rust stains or discoloration on the floor beneath your washer are a sign that a slow leak has been occurring for some time, even if you haven't noticed standing water. These gradual leaks are particularly damaging because they can warp flooring, promote mold growth inside walls, and weaken subfloor materials before the problem becomes visually apparent. If your laundry area has a musty smell that you cannot eliminate, a hidden leak may be the cause.</p>
            <p>On front-load washers, inspect the door boot seal regularly for signs of wear. If you see water dripping from the door area during a cycle, or if the seal feels brittle, cracked, or has visible tears, it needs replacement. Water stains running down the front of the machine below the door are a clear indicator. For top-load washers, check around the lid and the back of the machine where the fill hoses connect &mdash; loose or corroded fittings at these connection points are common leak sources.</p>

            <h2>How We Fix It</h2>
            <p>Diagnosing a washer leak requires a methodical approach because water can travel along surfaces and appear far from the actual source. Our technicians start by running the washer through its cycles while carefully observing all potential leak points. We inspect every external and internal hose connection, checking for cracks, loose clamps, and deteriorated rubber. Each connection is tightened or replaced as needed to ensure a watertight seal throughout the system.</p>
            <p>For front-load washers with boot seal leaks, we remove the old seal and install a new OEM-compatible boot gasket, carefully aligning it with the tub and door frame to ensure proper sealing under pressure. If the tub seal and bearing assembly is the source, we disassemble the outer tub to access the seal, replace both the seal and bearings as a set, and reassemble the machine. Replacing these components together prevents the new seal from being damaged by worn bearings and ensures a lasting repair.</p>
            <p>We also inspect the water inlet valve for cracks in its housing and test its solenoids to confirm they shut off completely when the cycle ends. A valve that fails to close fully can cause slow, continuous leaks that are easy to overlook. Every leak repair begins with our $89 diagnostic fee, which applies toward the total repair cost. All parts and labor carry our 60-day warranty, and the majority of washer leak repairs are completed in a single same-day appointment.</p>
