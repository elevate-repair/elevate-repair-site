            <h1>Why Won't My Washer Drain?</h1>
            <p class="hero-text">A washing machine that leaves standing water in the drum has a blockage or failure somewhere in its drain path — from the pump filter to the drain hose to the pump motor itself. This guide explains the most common causes across both top-load and front-load washers, what you can safely check yourself, and what a technician tests during diagnosis.</p>

                <h2>Quick Answer</h2>
                <p>The single most common cause of a washer that won't drain is a clogged drain pump filter. Every washer has a filter designed to catch lint, coins, and small debris before they reach the pump. When the filter becomes packed with buildup, water flow slows to a stop. On front-load washers this filter is accessible through a small panel at the bottom front of the machine and can be cleaned by the homeowner. If the filter is clear, the next most likely cause is a failed drain pump motor — the electrically driven component that forces water out of the tub. A washer that hums loudly during the drain phase but cannot empty the tub usually has a pump motor that has seized or burned out, or a foreign object lodged against the impeller.</p>

                <h2>Common Causes</h2>
                <p><strong>Clogged Drain Pump Filter:</strong> The pump filter is a mesh or plastic screen positioned just upstream of the drain pump impeller. Its job is to intercept debris — lint, hair, coins, buttons, small socks — that would otherwise damage the pump or block the drain line. Over months of normal use this filter accumulates enough material to significantly restrict flow. The washer may drain slowly at first, taking several extra minutes to empty, before eventually failing to drain at all. On front-load washers the filter housing is reached by opening a small access panel at the lower-front corner of the machine; on most top-load washers the pump filter is built into the pump assembly itself and requires partial disassembly to access. A full or partially blocked filter is the first component to inspect before assuming a pump motor failure.</p>

                <p><strong>Failed Drain Pump Motor:</strong> The drain pump is an electrically driven centrifugal pump that draws water from the tub and pushes it through the drain hose. The pump motor contains windings that can burn out, bearings that can seize, and a plastic impeller that can crack or chip. A pump motor failure usually announces itself with one of two sounds: a loud sustained hum indicating the motor is receiving power but the rotor cannot turn (seized bearings or impeller blockage), or complete silence during the drain phase (motor windings have failed and the pump receives no power). Either condition results in water remaining in the drum. Error codes such as F21, F9 E1 (Whirlpool/Maytag), OE (LG), or 5E/E2 (Samsung) are the manufacturers' standard codes for drain system failures and typically appear when the drain cycle exceeds a timed threshold.</p>

                <p><strong>Foreign Object in the Pump:</strong> Even with a functioning filter, small and rigid objects — coins, underwire from bras, hair clips, pen caps — can work their way past the filter screen and lodge directly against the pump impeller. An impeller that is mechanically blocked cannot spin regardless of whether the motor is receiving power. The motor will hum at full current draw with no impeller movement. If the obstruction is not cleared quickly, the sustained overcurrent condition can overheat the motor windings and cause secondary motor failure. What begins as a simple foreign-object removal can become a pump replacement if the blockage is left unaddressed through repeated cycle attempts.</p>

                <p><strong>Kinked or Obstructed Drain Hose:</strong> The corrugated drain hose that runs from the back of the washer to the standpipe or laundry sink can develop problems independent of the pump. A hose that has been pushed against the wall when the machine was moved back into its alcove can kink sharply, partially or fully blocking water flow. Internally, soap scum, lint, and hard-water deposits can gradually accumulate along the hose walls, narrowing the passage over time. A slow drain that worsens gradually — rather than stopping abruptly — is more consistent with hose buildup than a sudden pump failure. The hose connection at the standpipe can also slip below the inlet of the pipe, creating a siphon condition where water drains out during the wash cycle before the machine intends to drain.</p>

                <p><strong>Lid Switch or Door Lock Blocking Drain Advance:</strong> On some washer models — particularly older top-load designs — the control sequence requires confirmation from the lid switch before advancing from the wash phase to the drain and spin phase. If the lid switch has partially failed, the machine may complete agitation but then pause indefinitely at the drain step, never signaling the pump to run. The tub holds water not because the pump has failed but because the control system never commanded it to run. A washer stuck in this state may display no error code, leaving standing water in the drum as the only symptom. This cause is less common than a pump or filter fault but worth considering on top-load models where the lid switch is already suspect.</p>

                <p><strong>Control Board Fault:</strong> The main control board outputs the relay signal that activates the drain pump motor at the appropriate point in the cycle. A failed relay on the board can prevent that signal from reaching the pump even when the pump motor itself is mechanically and electrically intact. A control board drain relay failure is uncommon compared to filter and pump faults, but it is the correct diagnosis when the filter is clean, the pump tests with proper motor resistance, and the drain hose is clear — yet the pump still never runs. Board failures are often preceded by other erratic behavior: cycles ending at unexpected points, incorrect error codes, or buttons responding inconsistently.</p>

                <h2>Checks You Can Do Yourself</h2>
                <p><strong>Clean the drain pump filter (front-load washers):</strong> Locate the small rectangular access panel at the lower-front of your machine. Place a shallow pan and several towels on the floor beneath it before opening — residual water in the pump housing will spill out. Unscrew the filter cap slowly counterclockwise, allowing water to drain into the pan. Remove the filter completely, rinse it under running water to clear all lint and debris, and inspect the filter housing cavity for any objects that may have bypassed the filter. Reinstall the filter finger-tight, run a short rinse-and-spin cycle, and confirm the machine drains fully. If it drains after filter cleaning, no further repair is needed.</p>

                <p><strong>Inspect the drain hose:</strong> Pull the washer slightly away from the wall — just enough to see the hose routing from the back of the machine to the standpipe or utility sink. Trace the hose along its full length looking for any sharp bends, kinks, or compressed sections. If the hose was pushed against the wall, straighten it into a smooth curve. Confirm that the hose end inserted into the standpipe reaches only 6–8 inches into the pipe opening — inserting it deeper creates a siphon. A hose pushed too far down the pipe can cause the machine to drain continuously during the wash cycle or fail to drain completely at the end.</p>

                <p><strong>Note any error codes:</strong> If your washer displays a drain-related error code (F21, OE, 5E, E2, or similar), record it and look it up in your owner's manual. These codes confirm that the control board has already detected a drain timeout — meaning the machine attempted to drain and failed — which narrows the fault to the filter, pump, or hose rather than a control system issue.</p>

                <p><strong>Listen during the drain phase:</strong> Stand near the washer when it should be draining and listen carefully. A healthy pump produces a steady low-pitched whirring sound lasting 60–90 seconds per drain cycle. A loud sustained hum with no water movement indicates a seized impeller or blocked pump. Complete silence when the pump should be running indicates a motor winding failure or a control board relay that is not sending the activation signal.</p>

                <h2>What NOT to Do</h2>
                <p>Do not run repeated drain-only cycles in an attempt to force a clogged or blocked pump to clear itself. If the pump impeller is mechanically obstructed by a foreign object, the motor runs against maximum resistance with every attempt. The sustained overcurrent draw overheats the motor windings progressively — each failed attempt degrades the motor further. What would have been a straightforward foreign-object extraction becomes a pump replacement after several forced attempts.</p>

                <p>Do not use the washer with standing water sitting in the drum for more than a day. Stagnant water in the tub, pump housing, and hoses creates ideal conditions for mold and mildew growth inside the machine. Musty odors that develop after a drain failure are often caused by mold establishing in the pump filter housing and the rubber door gasket (on front-load models), areas where water pools and is not easily reached by a normal cleaning cycle.</p>

                <p>Do not disconnect the drain hose from the standpipe and attempt to manually drain the tub into a bucket by lowering the hose — unless you intend to empty the entire tub volume that way. Lowering a full hose below the tub water level will siphon all water out rapidly and uncontrolled. If the goal is to manually drain the tub before service, use the pump filter access procedure described above, which releases water at a controllable rate into a prepared pan.</p>

                <h2>When to Seek Professional Diagnosis</h2>
                <p>If cleaning the pump filter and straightening the drain hose does not restore draining, the fault is in a component that requires disassembly to inspect or test: the pump motor, the pump impeller cavity (for foreign objects behind the filter), or the control board relay. Confirming a pump motor failure requires measuring the motor winding resistance with a multimeter and comparing it to the specification for the model — an open or shorted reading confirms the motor has failed. Confirming a control board relay failure requires measuring output voltage at the pump terminals during a drain command. Neither test can be completed without partial cabinet disassembly and controlled power-on testing.</p>

                <p>A washer displaying a drain error code with a clean filter and unobstructed hose is a direct diagnosis path toward a pump motor or control board fault. A washer with no error code that simply holds water without attempting to drain is more likely a lid switch or control sequence issue, which has a different diagnostic path than a mechanical drain system failure.</p>

                <h2>What a Technician Evaluates</h2>
                <p>A technician begins by confirming the drain filter is clean and the drain hose is unobstructed — the same steps available to the homeowner. With those ruled out, the technician accesses the drain pump assembly, which on most machines requires removing the front panel or tilting the cabinet. The pump impeller cavity is inspected visually and by hand for any foreign objects that passed through or around the filter. The motor windings are tested for continuity and resistance; an open reading confirms motor failure. On front-load washers the pump is also rotated by hand to check for bearing seizure or physical impeller damage.</p>

                <p>If the pump tests electrically sound and spins freely by hand, the technician measures the control board's output voltage to the pump terminals during a commanded drain cycle. No voltage at the pump terminals with a functioning pump motor confirms a relay failure on the control board. On older top-load washers the technician also tests the lid switch for proper continuity in the closed position, since a partially failed switch can prevent the drain phase from initiating without throwing a specific error code. Common repairs for a washer that won't drain: pump filter cleaning; drain pump motor replacement; foreign object removal from pump; drain hose replacement; control board relay repair or board replacement; lid switch replacement.</p>

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                <p><strong>My washer drains slowly but does eventually empty — is that a partial blockage?</strong> Yes. A slow drain that completes after an extended period is the classic symptom of a partially restricted filter or hose rather than a complete pump motor failure. The pump is generating enough pressure to move water, but restricted flow means it takes significantly longer than normal. Cleaning the pump filter is the appropriate first step. If drainage speed returns to normal after cleaning, no further action is needed. If it remains slow after the filter is clean, a partial hose obstruction or a pump impeller that is partially damaged and running below normal efficiency is likely.</p>

                <p><strong>Why does my washer smell musty even after I run a cleaning cycle?</strong> A persistent musty odor after running a cleaning cycle almost always means water is pooling in a location the cleaning cycle does not flush effectively — typically the pump filter housing or, on front-load washers, the rubber door gasket folds. A cleaning cycle circulates hot water and cleaner through the tub but may not generate enough flow through a partially blocked filter housing to displace stagnant water there. Remove and clean the pump filter manually, wipe down the door gasket folds with a diluted bleach solution, and run another cleaning cycle. If odors persist, residual mold in the pump housing or hoses may require a more intensive cleaning or component replacement.</p>

                <p><strong>My washer displays error code F21 — what does that mean?</strong> F21 is Whirlpool's (and Maytag's) drain fault code, triggered when the control board detects that the drain cycle has not completed within its expected time window — typically 8 minutes for most models. The code does not identify which component has failed; it indicates that water remained in the tub longer than the board's timeout threshold. The diagnostic sequence for F21 is: clean the pump filter, check the drain hose for kinks, then test the pump motor. Samsung uses 5E or E2 for the same fault; LG uses OE; Bosch and Miele use F18 or similar. All of these codes mean the same thing regardless of manufacturer: the drain cycle timed out.</p>

                <p><strong>Can I use my washer if it won't drain?</strong> Running a full wash cycle on a machine that cannot drain leaves clothes sitting in dirty wash water when the cycle ends — which requires manual extraction of the load and the standing water before attempting any fix. Beyond the inconvenience, repeated cycle attempts with a seized pump motor risk motor winding damage. The safest approach is to stop using the machine, manually drain the tub via the pump filter access, remove the load, and diagnose the drain fault before running another cycle.</p>

                <p><strong>The pump runs but water level doesn't drop — could that be a drain hose siphon issue?</strong> If the pump audibly runs during the drain phase but water level in the tub barely changes, one possibility is that the drain hose is positioned too low — below the bottom of the tub — and water is siphoning back in as fast as the pump expels it. This creates a condition where the pump works continuously but never achieves a net reduction in tub water level. The drain hose standpipe entry height should be between 34 and 96 inches above the floor per most manufacturer specifications; a hose that enters the standpipe at floor level or slopes downward before rising is likely creating a siphon. Repositioning the hose to maintain a proper high-loop before the standpipe entry typically resolves this without any part replacement.</p>
